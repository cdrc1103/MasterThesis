Such phenomena are undesirable from the point of view of stability of the formulation and/or with respect to consumer comfort in so far as they can destabilise the composition and/or affect the aesthetic appearance of the product and/or lead to cosmetic discomfort upon application to the skin and/or the hair, or else to the concentration of active agents being limited in these formulations, which means that products that are sufficiently effective cannot be obtained.    In particular, anti-sun compositions are often in the form of an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion, of gels or of anhydrous products which contain, at various concentrations, one or more lipophilic and/or hydrophilic, insoluble and/or soluble, organic and/or inorganic screening agents capable of selectively absorbing harmful UV radiation. These screening agents and the amounts thereof are selected according to the desired protection factor. Depending on whether they are lipophilic or, conversely, hydrophilic in nature, these screening agents can be distributed, respectively, either into the fatty phase or into the aqueous phase of the final composition. </p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"p-00006-en\" num=\"0006\"> UV screening agents of the benzophenone type are lipophilic UVA screening agents that are particularly advantageous for anti-sun cosmetic formulations. However, their photoprotective capacity when formulated is quite limited in the usual cosmetic carriers containing oils, such as oxyethylenated or oxypropylenated fatty (mono/poly) alcohols (\"Cetiol HE\" from Henkel or \"Witconol APM\" from Witco) or else fatty esters such as C12-C15 alkyl benzoate (\"Finsolv TN\" from Finetex) , fatty acid triglycerides, for example Miglyol® 812 sold by the company Dynamit Nobel, or amino acid derivatives (\"Eldew SL205\" from Ajinomoto), because the solubility of these screening agents in these oils commonly used in formulation is not completely satisfactory. The result of this is: either the appearance over time of crystallisation in the formulations, which is detrimental to the good quality, stability and effectiveness of the anti-sun products; or the fact that the concentration of screening agents in the formulations has to be limited, thereby making it impossible to obtain sufficiently effective products. </p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"p-00007-en\" num=\"0007\"> There exists therefore the need to find novel solvents for effectively dissolving lipophilic screening agents of the benzophenone type in order to improve their solubility in the oils in the cosmetic or   dermatological formulation carriers containing them, without the drawbacks listed above. </p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"p-00008-en\" num=\"0008\"> Pyrrolidone derivatives are known as penetrating agents for active agents such as oleocanthal in application WO 2008/01240 or such as asprotadil alkyl esters in patent US 6 673 841. </p>\n",

      "AU2002234127B2: (57) Abstract: The present invention provides a method of preventing thc appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration on the skin. This is achieved by the topical application to the skin of a composition containing a first platelet of alumina treated with a metal  oxide, a second platelet treated with a spherical scattering component, and a cosmetic or pharmaceutical cartier. The compositions  can also contain a standard interference pigment, such as a white and a yellow interference pigment to further blend the color to  closely match the natural skin tone. The combination of pigments and platelets creates a mosaic of color and optically manipulates  light such that lines, wrinkles, disfigurations and discolorations on the skin appear to substantially vanish. In addition to the pigments and platelet components, a non-interference pigment can also be added to fine-tune the matching of color to the skin tone. The  umina platelet alone is metallic-looking; however, when it is tempered with the other platelet containing the spherical scattering component, the net effect is that the skirl appears natural, luminous and flawless.\n",

Please cancel claims 1-6, 8-9, 12-14, 16-20, 22-25, and 27-34 without prejudice or disclaimer. Applicant reserves the right to pursue the cancelled subject matter in one or more continuation or divisional applications.  Claims 7, 10-11, 15, 21, and 26 have been amended. New claims 35 and 36 have been added. The amendments and support for these amendments and new claims are discussed in detail below.  Applicants respectfully request reconsideration and withdrawal of the objection to the claims and the pending rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) and § 112, first and second paragraphs.  Examiner Interview Applicant thanks Examiner Slobodyansky for her time spent on a telephone interview with Applicant's representative, Brian R. Dorn, on August 10, 2007. Patentability of the claims was discussed. No agreement was reached. This amendment and response is consistent with the discussion.  Claims Applicant has amended claim 7 to recite \"[a]n isolated Dispersin B (DspB) polypeptide comprising a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid sequence of at least 95% sequence identity to nucleotides 61 to 1143 of S EQ ID NO: 1, wherein the DspB polypeptide cleaves a 1--, 4 glycosidic bond of/3-substituted N-acetylglucosaminide.\" Sequence identity is discussed in the specification at page 10, line 34 to page 12, line 2. In particular, the specification recites a sequence identity of 95% at page 11, lines 20-25. Further, claim 7 recites nucleotides 61 to 1143, which represents the coding sequence for the mature DspB polypeptide. A signal sequence is discussed at page 9, lines 7-9. At Example 3 at page 38, lines 1-9, the coding sequence for the mature DspB polypeptide (amino acids 21-281) is exemplified. Since the first amino acids are the signal sequence, then the signal sequence is encoded in the nucleic acid at U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/538,902 Confirmation No. 8859 Amendment dated August 16, 2007 Reply to Office Action of July 11, 2007 nucleotides 1-60 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Hence the coding sequence of the mature DspB polypeptide begins at nucleotide 61. The three 3' terminal nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1 are TGA, a well known stop codon. Thus, the coding sequence for the mature DspB polypeptide is nucleotides 61 to 1143. Additionally, the cleavage activity of the DspB polypeptide is supported at page 22, lines 16-20.  Claim 10 has been amended to depend on claim 7 and is supported at page 21, lines 3-28.  Claim 11 has been amended to depend on claim 7 and is supported at page 29, line 31 to page 33, line 2.  Claim 15 has been amended to depend on claim 7 and is supported at page 34, lines 6-22.  New claim 35 has been added. New claim 35 depends on claim 7 and is supported at page 33, lines 3-10.  New claim 36 has been added. New claim 36 depends on claim 7 and is supported at page 31, lines 12-35.  Claims 21 and 26 have been amended to depend on claim 7. Thus, these claims incorporate all of the limitations of claim 7. Support for claims 21 and 26 can be found throughout the specification, including at page 4, lines 24-28; page 22, line 32 to page 23, line 27; page 24, line 4 to page 27, line 11; page 28, lines 14-23; and page 29, lines 15-30. Following the Amendment, method claims 21 and 26 are linked to elected polypeptide claim 7. Applicant hereby requests rejoinder of non-elected claims 21 and 26 under MPEP § 821.04(b) upon the allowability of claim 7.  Objections to the Claims The Examiner objects to claim 7 as it is dependent on non-elected claims 1-4. As currently amended, claim 7 is an independent claim. This objection is now moot.  The Examiner objects to claims 7-11 and 15 due to the comma following the term \"soluble\". This has been deleted.  In view of the foregoing, Applicant respectfully requests removal of the objections to the U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/538,902 Confirmation No. 8859 Amendment dated August 16, 2007 Reply to Office Action of July 11, 2007 Rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph The Examiner rejects claims 7-11 and 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph, for allegedly lacking written description and enablement. Both rejections are directed to the recitation of \"an active fragment or variant of/3-N-acetylgluosaminidase\". The recitation of \"an active fragment or variant of/3-N-acetylgluosaminidase\" has been deleted from the pending claims. In view of amended claims 7-11 and 15, Applicant respectfully requests removal of the rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.  Rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph The Examiner rejects claims 7 and 10 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, for alleged indefiniteness. The Examiner asserts that \"an isolated amino acid sequence\" in claim 7 and \"the amino acid sequence of claim 8 or 9\" in claim 10 are indefinite terms. Applicant has amended the claims and these terms are not recited in the currently amended claims 7 and 10. In view of the amendments, the rej ections of claim 7 and claim 10 are now moot, and Applicant respectfully requests removal of these rejections.  Rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) The Examiner rejects claims 7-11 and 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as allegedly anticipated by each of Clarke et al. (2005), Graham et al. (2005), and Somerville et al. (2005).  The Examiner asserts that the cited references disclose a polypeptide sequence that has 11.6%, 12.5%, and 11.6% identity to SEQ ID NO:2. In view of amended claim 7, the DspB polypeptide comprises \"a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid sequence of at least 95% sequence identity to nucleotides 61 to 1143 of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the DspB polypeptide cleaves 0-substituted N-acetylglucosaminide.\" The cited polypeptide sequences are not encoded by a nucleic acid of at least 95% sequence identity to nucleotides 61 to 1143 ofSEQ ID NO:I. Thus, the cited art does not disclose each and every element of any of claims 7-11 and 15. In view of the foregoing, Applicant respectfully requests reconsideration and withdrawal of the rejections under 35 U.S.C.  U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/538,902 Confirmation No. 8859 Amendment dated August 16, 2007 Reply to Office Action of July 11,2007 In view of the above amendments and remarks, Applicant respectfully requests a Notice of Allowance. If the Examiner believes a telephone conference would advance the prosecution of this application, the Examiner is invited to telephone the undersigned at the below-listed telephone number.

Claims 1-34 are pending.  Election/Restrictions Applicant's election with traverse of Group II, claims 7-11 and 15, SEQ ID NO:2, in the reply filed on June 25, 2007 is acknowledged. The traversal is on the ground(s) \"that sufficient reasons and/or examples to justify a Restriction Requirement have not been provided. Applicants submit that it would not be unduly burdensome to examine the nucleic acids that encode the elected polypeptides. Applicants submit that it would not be unduly burdensome to search claims drawn to methods using the polypeptide of claims 8-9 or a composition of claim 11. A search of the polypeptide or composition will likely yield the same results as searching the methods themselves. Therefore, Applicants respectfully submit that the Examiner has not established an undue burden in examining Groups I to IV and VIII to X in the same application\" (Remarks, page 6).  This is not found persuasive because the examination of Groups I-IV and VIII-× would require additional search of patent and non-patent documents that are not required for Group II and would require additional considerations. Furthermore, Applicants are reminded that \"Process claims that depend from or otherwise include all the limitations of the patentable product will be entered as a matter of right if the amendment is presented prior to final rejection or allowance, whichever is earlier\" Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page 3 Art Unit: 1652 (Office action mailed May 24, 2007, pages 6-7). Applicants further argue \"that it would not be unduly burdensome to examine all of the polypeptides (A) to (E) (SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). These sequences are all highly identical to one another. The sequences only differ by several amino acid residues from one another. For example, SEQ ID NO:2 only differs from SEQ ID NO:6 at amino acid residues 103 and 168 (See Figure 1). A search of one sequence would likely yield the other sequences. Therefore, Applicants respectfully submit that the Examiner has not established an undue burden in examining Groups (A) to (E) in the same application\" (ibid). This is not found persuasive because the identity among sequences is in the range of 48.7%-30.5%.  Each sequence should be searched separately. It is noted that Applicants do not state that the sequences are obvious over each other. Therefore, each sequence should be searched and considered separately.  The requirement is still deemed proper and is therefore made FINAL.  Claims 1-6, 12-14 and 16-34 are withdrawn from further consideration pursuant to 37 CFR 1.142(b), as being drawn to a nonelected Groups I, II1-, there being no allowable generic or linking claim. Applicant timely traversed the restriction (election) requirement in the reply filed on June 25, 2007.  Claim Objections Claim 7 is objected to as dependent from non-elected claims 1-4. In the interests of the compact prosecution claim 7 was construed as if it were properly written, i.e.  included all limitations of claims 1-4.  Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page 4 Art Unit: 1652 Claims 7-11 and 15 are objected to because of the following informalities: a comma is not needed after \"soluble\".  Appropriate correction is required.  Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 112 The following is a quotation of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112:  The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and Of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, as containing subject matter which was not described in the specification in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that the inventor(s), at the time the application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are drawn to or depend from \"an active fragment or variant of 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase\". \"Active fragment\" as \"a portion of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 with similarities to the consensus sequence of the family glycosyl hydrolase\" (page 13, lines 4-10). Neither the consensus sequence nor the active fragments of SEQ ID NO:2 are disclosed. However, a consensus sequence is usually a small sequence that dies not exhibit enzymatic properties. Therefore, the genus of active fragments of 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase is defined by neither structure nor function, the specification defined \"functionally equivalent variants\" as \"polypeptide sequences structurally different from the dispersin B protein, but having no significant Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page Art Unit: 1652 functional difference from the protein\" (page 13, lines 11-15). Therefore, the genus of variants of 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase\" is defined by function only.  The specification discloses 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Actinobaciilus actinomycetemcomitans strain CU1000N having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 encoded by SEQ ID NO: 1 and 13-N-acetylglucosaminidases from different sources having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 4, 6, 8 or 10 that are 48.7%- 30.5% homologous to SEQ ID NO:2. The specification fails to describe any other representative species by any identifying characteristics or properties other than the functionality of being 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase and does not disclose the structure:  function correlation common to all members of the genus. Given this lack of description of representative species encompassed by the genus of the claim, the specification fails to sufficiently describe the claimed invention in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms that a skilled artisan would recognize that applicants were in possession of the claimed invention.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, because the specification, while being enabling for 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, fusion protein, a pharmaceutical composition and an antisepticsolution comprising thereof, does not reasonably provide enablement for 13-Nacetylglucosaminidase comprising \"an active fragment\" or variant of 13-Nacetylglucosaminidase having an undefined homology to SEQ ID NO:2. The specification does not enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page 6 Art Unit: 1652 which it is most nearly connected, to make the invention commensurate in scope with these claims.  Factors to be considered in determining whether undue experimentation is required, are summarized in In re Wands 858 F.2d 731,8 USPQ2nd 1400 (Fed. Cir, 1988). They include (1) the quantity of experimentation necessary, (2) the amount of direction or guidance presented, (3) the presence or absence of working examples, (4) the nature of the invention, (5) the state of the prior art, (6) the relative skill of those in the art, (7) the predictability or unpredictability of the art, and (8) the breadth of the claims.  Factors pertinent to this discussion include predictability of the art, guidance in the specification, breadth of claims, and the amount of experimentation that would be necessary to use the invention.  While recombinant and mutagenesis techniques are known, it is not routine in the art to screen for multiple substitutions or multiple modifications, as encompassed by the instant claims, and the positions within a protein's sequence where amino acid modifications can be made with a reasonable expectation of success in obtaining the desired activity/utility are limited in any protein and the result of such modifications is unpredictable. In addition, one skilled in the art would expect any tolerance to modification for a given protein to diminish with each further and additional modification, e.g. multiple substitutions.  The specification does not support the broad scope of the claims which encompass active fragments or variants of 13-N-acetylglucosaminidases having an Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page 7 Art Unit: 1652 undefined structure because the specification does not establish: (A) regions of the protein structure which may be modified without affecting the 13-Nacetylglucosaminidases enzymatic activity; (B) the general tolerance of 13-Nacetylglucosaminidases to modification and extent of such tolerance; (C) a rational and predictable scheme for modifying any of an enzyme residues with an expectation of obtaining the desired biological function; and (D) the specification provides insufficient guidance as to which of the essentially infinite possible choices is likely to be successful.  Without sufficient guidance, beyond that provided, making 13-Nacetylglucosaminidase comprising an active fragment of SEQ ID NO:2 or a variant thereof having no defined homology to SEQ ID NO;2 is unpredictable and the experimentation left to those skilled in the art is unnecessarily, and improperly, extensive and undue. The scope of the claims must bear a reasonable correlation with the scope of enablement (In re Fisher, 166 USPQ 19 24 (CCPA 1970)).  The following is a quotation of the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112:  The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.  Claims 7 and 10 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which applicant regards as the invention.  Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page 8 Art Unit: 1652 Claim 7 recites \"An isolated amino acid sequence\". \"Sequence\" is not a chemical compound and cannot be isolated. Amending the claim to recite a protein, a polypeptide or 13-N-acetylglucosaminidase, for example, would obviate this rejection.  Claim 10 recites 'the amino acid sequence of claim 8 or 9\". There is no antecedent basis for this phrase as claims 8 and 9 are drawn to 13-Nacetylglucosaminidase protein.  Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102 The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:  A person shall be entitled to a patent unless - (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of applicatior for patent in the United States.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Clarke et al.  Clarke et al (form PTO-1449 filed June 14, 2005, reference AA) teach 13-Nacetylglucosaminidase having the amino acid that is 11.6% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 of the instant invention and a fusion protein comprising thereof (page 8806, 1 st column; page 8811, Table 3). Therefore, it is comprising an active fragment thereof and is a variant thereof.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Graham et al.  Application/Control Number: 10/538,902 Page Art Unit: 1652 Graham et al (form PTO-1449 filed June 14, 2005, reference AB) teach 13-Nacetylhexoaminidase having the amino acid that is 12.5% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 of the instant invention and a fusion protein comprising thereof (page 16823, 1 st column; page 16824, 1 st column). Therefore, it is comprising an active fragment thereof and is variant thereof.  Claims 7-11 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Somerville et al.  Somerville et al (form PTO-1449 filed June 14, 2005, reference AD) teach I -Nacetylglucosaminidase having the amino acid that is 11.6% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 of the instant invention and a fusion protein comprising thereof (page 6751; page 6753).  Therefore, it is comprising an active fragment thereof and is a variant thereof.  Conclusion The art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's disclosure.

No. 10/538,902 Confirmation No. 8859 Response to Restriction Requirement dated June 25, 2007 Reply to Office Action of May 24, 2007 REMARKS In the Office Action of May 24, 2007, the Examiner requires restriction to one of eleven claim groups and one of five sequence identifiers (A) - (E).  Without acquiescing to the statements made in the Restriction Requirement, Applicants hereby elect Group II, claims 7-11 and 15, with traverse, for further prosecution in the instant application. In addition, Applicants elect Group (A) sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, with traverse.  The traversal is on the ground that sufficient reasons and/or examples to justify a Restriction Requirement have not been provided. Applicants submit that it would not be unduly burdensome to examine the nucleic acids that encode the elected polypeptides. Applicants submit that it would not be unduly burdensome to search claims drawn to methods using the polypeptide of claims 8-9 or a composition of claim 11. A search of the polypeptide or composition will likely yield the same results as searching the methods themselves. Therefore, Applicants respectfully submit that the Examiner has not established an undue burden in examining Groups I to IV and VIII to X in the same application.  Additionally, Applicants submit that it would not be unduly burdensome to examine all of the polypeptides (A) to (E) (SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). These sequence are all highly identical to one another. The sequences only differ by several amino acid residues from one another. For example, SEQ ID NO:2 only differs from SEQ ID NO:6 at amino acid residues 103 and 168 (See Figure 1). A search of one sequence would likely yield the other sequences.  Therefore, Applicants respectfully submit that the Examiner has not established an undue burden in examining Groups (A) to (E) in the same application.  Applicants have amended claims 20-22 and 26 to link these claims to product claims.  Support for the amendments can be found at page 4, line 24 to page 5, line 4 and at page 5, lines 22-28. No new matter has been added by the amendment.  Applicants would like to note that when product claims are elected and subsequently found allowable, withdrawn process claims that depend from or otherwise include all the limitations of the allowable product claim(s) should be rejoined in accordance with MPEP § 821.04. In view of the current amendments, claims 12-15 and 20-31 link to the elected Group II Appl. No. 10/538,902 Confirmation No. 8859 Response to Restriction Requirement dated June 25, 2007 Reply to Office Action of May 24, 2007 In view of the foregoing, Applicants believe that the claims are in condition for allowance and such action is respectfully requested.

      "AU2004209987B2: (57) Abstract: A carotenoid substance called zeaxanthin, when ingested orally at suitable dosages such as 30 to 100 mg/day for a  span of 1 to 2 weeks, can provide effective protection against sunburns, and can give skin a darker tint that emulates a healthy suntan.   In tests involving adults, it was found that zeaxanthin dosages of 30 to about 80 mg per day were sufficient to induce: (i) a mild but  noticeable tinting, shading, or darkening of skin color, comparable to a mild suntan; (ii) a substantial increase in the person's ability  to withstand elevated levels of sun or UV exposure without any subsequent pain or discomfort, and without the subsequent peeling  and flaking that characterizes sunburns; and, (iii) an increased ability of reddened and sunburned skin to convert into intact skin that  looks browned and healthily tanned. By reducing the amount of exposure to sunlight (or tanning lights) that are required to achieve  a desired level of tanning, zeaxanthin can reduce the risks of skin cancer, premature aging or wrinkling, and similar skin problems.  Since zeaxanthin also has retina-protecting properties and reduces the risk of a disease called macular degeneration, oral ingestion of these dosages of a zeaxanthin to enhance a tanned appearance and/or to protect against sun damage is believed to pose no health risks, and can offer several benefits due to the anti-oxidant and other activities of zeaxanthin.\n",

      "AU2005263450B2: (57) Abstract: Doses of cosmetic fluid dispensed from a roll-on dispenser can fluctuate significantly between successive applica-  tions. This problem can be alleviated by perturbing flow within the roll-on housing (3), such as air flow, by forming flow perturbators  on the interior side wall (11) of the housing (3). These perturbators can alternatively or additionally comprise lateral beads (20) or  notching an interior sealing ring (17). The dispenser housing (3) preferably also includes a spider (4) normally located between the roller and the bottle interior, and preferably a resilient spider (4) having an facing surface parallel with the roller that can control the  epth of liquid film adhering to the roller, which when the roller is a ball means a concave upper face of similar radius of curvature to that of the ball.

      "AU2006278264B2:  (57) Abstract: The present invention is directed to novel tissue protective peptides. The tissue protective peptides of the invention may bind to a tissue protective receptor complex. In particular, the present invention is drawn to tissue protective peptides derived from or sharing consensus sequences with portions of cytokine receptor ligands, including Erythropoietin (EPO), that are not in-  volved in the binding of the ligand to the receptor complex, e.g., to the EPO receptor homodimer. Accordingly, the tissue protective  peptides of the invention are derived from the amino acid sequences of regions of cytokine receptor ligands that are generally located  on or within the region of the ligand protein that is opposite of the receptor complex, i.e., are generally derived from amino acid  sequences of regions of the ligand protein that face away from the receptor complex while the ligand is bound to the receptor. The  invention is further directed to the consensus sequences for use in engineering a synthetic tissue protective peptide. These tissue  protective peptides also include fragments, chimeras, as well as peptides designed to mimic the spatial localization of key amino  acid residues within the tissue protective receptor ligands, e.g., EPO. The invention further encompasses methods for treating or  preventing a disease or disorder using tissue protective peptides of the current invention. The invention also encompasses methods  for enhancing excitable tissue function using tissue protective peptides of the current invention.\n",

      "AU2006279652B2: (57) Abstract: A computer-controlled system determines attributes of a frexel, an area of human skin, and applies a modifying  agent (RMA) at the pixel level, typically to make the skin appear more youthful and so more attractive. The system scans the frexel,  identifies unattractive attributes, and applies the RMA, typically with an inkjet printer. The identified attributes relate to reflectance  and may refer to features such as irregular-looking light and dark spots, age-spots, scars, and bruises. Identified attributes may also  relate to the surface topology of the skin, for more precisely enhancing surface irregularities such as bumps and wrinkles. Feature  mapping may be used, for example to make cheeks appear pinker and cheekbones more prominent. The RMA can be applied in  greement with identified patterns, such as adding red to a red frexel, or in opposition, such as adding green or blue to a red frexel, according to idealized models of attractiveness.\n",
      "AU2006279800B2: (57) Abstract: A system and method that scans areas of a human body to identify unattractive characteristics and make cosmetic  enhancements is modified for medical monitoring and optionally for treatment. A 3-D model of the exterior surface of the human  body is created, and the scanned data is analyzed by characteristics of reflectance and surface topology to identify unhealthy charac-  teristics. Because people will use a cosmetics system widely and frequently, base lines of patients' conditions can be created through  frequent monitoring over a long time period, so that potentially dangerous changes from the base line can identified quickly and  reported on. When appropriate, precise applications of medications to treat affected areas may be made automatically. Controlled and precisely directed dosages of medications may be applied to reduce the risk of undesirable side effects. Medicines may also be applied over a large area of skin and during a long period of time to achieve desired treatments.\n",

      "AU2006346369B2: (57) Abstract: The present invention discloses an improved nanoemulsion comprising a uniform and discrete range of very small particle nano-sized diameters. This uniformity results in improved bioavailability of incorporated compounds (i.e., pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals) as reflected in various pharmacokinetic parameters including, but not limited to, decreased Tmax, increased Cmax, and increased AUC. The improved method of making these uniform nanoemulsions utilizes microfluidization which differs in both process and mechanics when compared to conventional milling and grinding techniques used to generate nanoparticulate compositions. Further, the improvement results, in part, from a novel step of mixing a substantially soluble compound into a heated dispersion medium. This is unlike current nanoparticulate composition methods that mix an insoluble compound with an unheated dispersion medium. Further, these nanoemulsions are observed to be bacterial-resistant and stable to extremes in both temperature and pH changes. Consequently, these nanoemulsions are expected to have a significantly prolonged shelf-life than currently available nanoemulsions.\n",

      "AU2007224940B2: (57) Abstract: Disclosed is a method in which poloxamer, a resin, and/or a tocopherol is/are fused, and the material that is to be treated is intimately dispersed with said melt. After being introduced into the melt, the material that is to be treated is coated with water to prevent hardening, and the spontaneously forming gel is homogenized. The obtained product is composed of a transparent gel that is based on at least one poloxamer, a resin or a tocopherol, and an active substance which is solubilized, dispersed, and stabilized therein and whose consistency ranges from solid, semisolid, i.e. aspic-like, to liquid. The micelles of said solubilized matter remain stable even when the same is diluted well below the CMC of poloxamer. The inventive products can be used for dissolving fats, peptides, resins, and all types of resinous materials, removing fats, peptides, resins, and all types of resinous materials from surfaces, cleaning, and lubricating, according to the solubilized active substances used. If a vegetable substance is intimately dispersed in such a melt, the melt is cooled instead of being coated with water. The melt turns brittle and can then be coarsely chopped and ground in a chopper-grinder without producing dust and can then be finely ground in a wet state with water in a hammer mill or an emulsifying mill until the crystals of the melt have been reduced to a diameter of less than 5 micrometers. The crystals of the melt are then dissolved or dispersed in additional water and are added to the humus soil in order for the crystals to be absorbed by the plant via the roots thereof, or the crystals are sprayed directly to the part of the plant that lies above the ground.\n",

# Multi-Label Classification for Cosmetic Patents Using Neural Network
The aim of this thesis is to identify, implement and evaluate suitable approaches for the classification of patents in the cosmetic domain using neural networks. For this purpose, a patent collection provided by the company Beiersdorf is used as application case. Particular to this patent collection is a company-internal labeling hierarchy that assigns a variable number of labels to each patent in correspondence to the product fields of Beiersdorf. In the course of this thesis, state-of-the-art neural network architectures like convolutional and recurrent neural networks as well as Transformers are applied to the patent data and evaluated regarding their ability to assign the correct labels to unknown patent instances. Properties of the considered data collection, that affect the performance of neural networks, are identified and implications for the prediction accuracy are inferred. A set of solutions is developed that leverages the special characteristics and different features found in a patent document to research the feasibility of automatically recommending labels for unknown patent instances with a high accuracy.

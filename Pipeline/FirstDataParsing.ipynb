The reduction of the indicator is proportional to the metabolic activity of the bacteria. After an incubation lasting 2 hours (except for C. Albicans, for which the incubation is 4 h), the metabolic activity of the bacteria is evaluated via an absorbence or a fluorescence reading. In fluorescence, the readings are taken at 544 nm (excitation) and at 590 nm (emission).')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00053-en'), ('@num', '0053'), ('#text', 'The most active compounds are selected and a dose effect (8 concentrations) is then performed as previously.')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00054-en'), ('@num', '0054'), ('#text', 'The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was then determined as being the lowest concentration of the compound tested for which a > 90% inhibition of growth of the bacterium or of the yeast was observed.')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00055-en'), ('@num', '0055'), ('#text', 'The following results are obtained:')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00056-en'), ('@num', '0056'), ('#text', 'E.coli MIC: >10 mg/ml')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00057-en'), ('@num', '0057'), ('#text', 'S.aureus MIC: 9.2 mg/ml')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00058-en'), ('@num', '0058'), ('#text', 'P. aeruginosa MIC: >10 mg/ml')]), OrderedDict([('@id', 'p-00059-en'), ('@num', '0059'), ('#text', 'C. albicans MIC: 2.8 mg/ml')])]\n"

The compositions are powder-to-liquid particles comprising a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid that has a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, at least one basic benefit or active agent and at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent surrounded by a shell comprising hydrophobic particles. The particles are stable in dry form and yet quickly transform into a liquid or cream-like form when subjected to shear. They can be advantageously formulated with other ingredients, particularly those unstable in the presence of water, into personal care compositions.</p><h4>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h4><p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">[0002] It is known that in the presence of a hydrophobic powder, such as a hydrophobic silicon dioxide powder (silicone-coated silica powder), water can be dispersed into fine droplets and enveloped by the hydrophobic material, thus preventing the droplets from rejoining. Such material has been described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdry water,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowdered water,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowder-to-liquid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and can have a water content of over 95%. It is formed by the intensive mixing of water with hydrophobic material. During this process water droplets are sheathed by the solid particles and prevented from flowing together again. The first experiments on the use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdry water\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a cosmetic base date from the 1960\\'s. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,393,155. These free-flowing, fine powders liquefy when rubbed on the skin.</p><p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">[0003] More recently, U.S. Pat. No. 6,290,941 describes cosmetic or pharmaceutical powder-to-liquid compositions comprising hydrophobically coated silica particles into which are incorporated water and a water soluble polymer, the composition containing substantially no oil. Such compositions are said to require less silica while retaining the water-holding capacity and permitting substantial elimination of added oil from the formula.</p><p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">[0004] WO 2011/075418 discloses a powdery composition comprising a) at least one powder in the form of core-shell particles, the core comprising liquid water or a liquid aqueous phase and the shell comprising hydrophobic or hydrophobized particles, and b) at least one powder comprising carrier, and b1) at least partially water soluble liquid and/or b2) a water reactive substrate each located in and/or on the carrier.</p><p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">[0005] Eshtiaghi et al., <i>Powder Technology</i>, Vol. 223, 2012, pages 65-76 describes a variety of powder-to-liquid materials and proposes mechanisms for their formation. Shell materials used included hydrophobic (silicone-coated) silica, hydrophobic glass beads and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or TEFLON) powder. Core materials included water, glycerol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Reported particle sizes for materials containing glycerin were 1200 and 3400 microns.</p><p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">[0006] US 2012/0315312 teaches core-shell particles, the shell of which includes aggregated, hydrophobicized silicon dioxide particles and the core of which includes a liquid phase. The ratio of the silicon dioxide particles to the liquid phase is 2:98 to 40:60 based on the total weight of the particles and 60-100% by weight of glycerol is present in the liquid phase.</p><p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">[0007] U.S. application Ser. No. 13/719,649, filed Dec. 19, 2012 teaches a powder comprising core/shell particles having an average particle size of less than 1000 microns, each particle comprising: 1) a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid having a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, and 2) a shell comprising hydrophobic particles. The particles can include an active.</p><p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">[0008] U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,120 teaches a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration, including, as the pharmaceutically active component, at least 5% by weight of minoxidil; an acid in an amount to completely solubilize the minoxidil; a solvent composition including at least two of water, a lower alcohol and a co-solvent selected from one or more of the group consisting of aromatic and polyhydric alcohols; wherein when the co-solvent includes propylene glycol, it is present in an amount of less than approximately 10% by weight.</p><p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">[0009] Although water-based powder-to-liquids are commonly described, they are not suitable for formulating with active agents that are unstable or incompatible with water, e.g., plant extracts prone to oxidation and/or hydrolysis. In addition, water-containing particles generally lack structural stability and are prone to collapse or leak during storage, and allow evaporation of water from the core.</p><p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">[0010] There is also a need for compositions that improve skin penetration of benefit agents. U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,913 teaches micellar compositions that enhance skin penetration. Although effective, these compositions can be difficult to manufacture and the cost of the products are relatively high.</p><p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">[0011] Applicants have now discovered novel compositions and a method of enhancing the topical application of benefit agents. The compositions include powder-to-cream particles containing a core without water and at least one acidic solubility enhancer. Such particles are stable and useful for formulating with a variety of active agents, even those that are prone to oxidation and/or hydrolysis. Compositions containing such particles are also convenient to use while providing a cream-like, pleasant skin feel and skin substantivity (the ability to remain on the skin). The compositions can be used in cosmetic, skin care, wound care, dermatologic, and other personal care products, as well as in other applications and industries.</p><h4>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h4><p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">[0012] The invention provides a powder including core/shell particles having an average particle size of less than 1000 microns, each particle contains a liquid core that is substantially free of water and includes A) a polar liquid having a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, B) a basic active ingredient, and C) from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent that is not an active ingredient; and a shell comprising hydrophobic particles.</p><p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">[0013] The invention also provides a method for topically administering the active ingredient by rubbing the powder on the skin of a human or animal. The powder turns into a liquid or gel like or cream like composition from which the active or benefit agent is absorbed into the skin.</p><h4>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h4><p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">[0014] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, all percentages are by weight based on the total weight of composition referred to.</p><p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">[0015] The disclosures of all patents and published applications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">[0016] As used herein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstantially free\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of an ingredient means containing about 5% by weight or less of that ingredient.

In certain embodiments, substantially free of an ingredient means completely free of the ingredient, i.e., containing none of that ingredient.</p><p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">[0017] As used herein, an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactive agent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbenefit agent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a compound (e.g., a synthetic compound or a compound isolated from a natural source) that has a cosmetic or therapeutic effect on tissue (e.g., a material capable of exerting a biological effect on the human body) such as therapeutic drugs or cosmetic agents. Examples of active agents include small molecules, peptides, proteins, nucleic acid materials, and nutrients such as minerals and extracts. The amount of the active agent used will depend on the active agent and/or the intended use of the end product. Active agents or benefit agents may be liquid, solid, or semi-solid. Further, active agents or benefit agents may be incorporated into the liquid core and/or the shell of the core/shell particles.</p><p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">[0018] As used herein \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolubility enhancer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means an agent used to enhance or improve the solubility of the active or benefit agent in the composition.</p><p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">[0019] As used herein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpharmaceutically acceptable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccosmetically acceptable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdermatologically acceptable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means suitable for use in contact with tissues (e.g., the skin, hair, mucosa, epithelium or the like) without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, irritation, or allergic response.</p><p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">[0020] As used herein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe and effective amount\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means an amount sufficient to provide a desired benefit at a desired level, but low enough to avoid serious side effects. The safe and effective amount of the ingredient or composition will vary with the area being treated, the age of the end user, the duration and nature of the treatment, the specific ingredient or composition employed, the particular carrier utilized, and like factors.</p><p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">[0021] As used herein, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreating\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreatment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means the alleviation or elimination of symptoms, cure, prevention, or inhibition of a disease or medical condition, or improvement of tissue growth/healing or cosmetic conditions such as reducing appearance of skin wrinkles/fine lines, under-eye bags, cellulites, skin marks/hyperpigmentation or uneven tone.</p><p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">[0022] To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It is understood that whether the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value.</p><p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">[0023] To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions herein are recited as a range from about amount X to about amount Y. It is understood that wherein a range is recited, the range is not limited to the recited upper and lower bounds, but rather includes the full range from about amount X through about amount Y, or any amount or range therein.</p><p id=\"h-0004\" num=\"0000\">[0000] Core/Shell Particles</p><p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">[0024] The powder of the invention comprises core/shell particles. Each particle comprises a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid, at least one basic active or benefit agent and from about 0.1% by weight to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent. The polar liquid has a minimum surface polarity. The liquid core is surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic particles.</p><p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">[0025] Particles according to the present invention have a liquid core surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic particles. The core includes an emulsion or suspension comprising a polar liquid as the continuous (external) phase. The dispersed (internal) phase comprises a hydrophobic material and/or solid particles.</p><p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">[0026] The hydrophobic particles of the shell are in the form of loose powder held together only by weak liquid-powder and powder-powder interactions via weak van der Waals forces. When subjected to slight forces such as by rubbing with the hands, the core/shell particles collapse and the powder becomes a liquid, cream or gel.</p><p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">[0027] Overall, the average particle size of the core/shell particles is less than about 1000 micrometers, usually from about 1 micrometer to about 1000 micrometers, or about 2 micrometers to about 200 micrometers, or about 3 micrometers to about 100 micrometers, or about 5 micrometers to about 50 micrometers. The average particle size of the core/shell particles can be determined by any particle size measurement method for dry particles known to the art, such as optical microscopy, electron microscopy, or sieve analysis.</p><p id=\"h-0005\" num=\"0000\">[0000] The Core</p><p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">[0028] The liquid core comprises a polar liquid that is not water and from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent, and at least one basic active or benefit agent, and has a minimum polar component of overall surface tension.</p><p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">[0029] As known in the art, the surface tension of a liquid (i.e., overall surface tension) is divided into two components, one representing a polar component and one representing a nonpolar (or dispersive) component. The polar component, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpercent (%) surface polarity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is determined using the method of Fowkes described in Fowkes, <i>Journal of Achievements in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, </i>24, 1 (2007) 137-145.</p><p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">[0030] Specifically, the overall surface tension of a sample is measured five times via the Wilhelmy plate method (described by Derelinch et. al. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeasurement of Interfacial Tension in Fluid-Fluid Systems\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in <i>Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science</i>, pages 3152-3166, Ed. By Arthur T. Hubbard, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2002), using a Kruss Tensiometer K100. The plate used is a standard platinum plate of 19.9 mm\\xc3\\x970.2 mm perimeter.</p><p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">[0031] The contact angle of each sample is also measured five times on a clean piece of poly(tertafluoroethylene) PTFE using a Kruss Drop Shape Analysis System DSA10. Measuring contact angle on PTFE is done as a means of separating the overall surface tension of each sample into polar and dispersive components. According to the Fowkes surface energy theory, the dispersive component of a liquid can be determined by knowing its overall surface tension and its contact angle against PTFE (which is a completely non-polar surface). The equation is as follows:</p><p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">[0032] <maths id=\"MATH-US-00001\" num=\"00001\"><math overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>&#963;</mi><mi>L</mi><mi>D</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><msubsup><mi>&#963;</mi><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\\xe2\\x81\\xa1</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\\xe2\\x81\\xa2</mo><mstyle><mspace width=\"0.3em\" height=\"0.3ex\" /></mstyle><mo>\\xe2\\x81\\xa2</mo><msub><mi>&#952;</mi><mi>PTFE</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>72</mn></mfrac></mrow></math></maths><br /> where &#952;<sub>PTFE</sub>=the contact angle measured between PTFE and the sample liquid. The dispersive surface tension component (&#963;<sub>L</sub><sup>D</sup>) can be determined for any liquid for which the overall surface tension (&#963;<sub>L</sub>) is known simply by measuring the contact angle between that liquid and PTFE (&#952;<sub>PTFE</sub>) and using the equation above. The polar surface tension component for the liquid is then determined by difference (&#963;<sub>A</sub><sup>P</sup>=&#963;<sub>L</sub>&#8722;&#963;<sub>L</sub><sup>D</sup>). The percent surface polarity is (%=&#963;<sub>L</sub><sup>P</sup>*100%/&#963;<sub>L</sub>). See also F. M. Fowkes, <i>Journal of Physical Chemistry, </i>67 (1963) 2538-2541. </p><p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">[0033] The polar liquid has a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, or at least 25%, or at least 26%, or at least 30%.</p><p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">[0034] The liquid core is substantially free of water. The liquid core may be completely free of water, that is, anhydrous.</p><p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">[0035] The liquid core contains a safe and effective amount of a basic active agent. The basic active agent has a pH of above 7 to about 14. Preferred compounds are weak base drugs or active agents. The basic active agent is present in the composition from about 0.001 percent to about 20 percent, or from about 0.01 percent to about 10 percent or from about 1 percent to about 5 percent by weight of the composition.</p><p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">[0036] Compounds suitable for use with the present invention are weak base drugs containing at least one amine functional group, which can be ionized to carry a positive charge. Non-limiting examples of the weak base drugs or active agents include benzocaine, procaine, lidocaine, codeine, ephedrine, epinephdrine, erythromycin, hydroquinone, scopolamine, and any compounds of plant extracts with at least one ionizeable amine functional group in the molecular structure.</p><p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">[0037] The liquid core contains from about 0.1% by weight to about 30%, for example from about 0.1% to about 20% or from about 0.1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 5% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent that is not an active ingredient or benefit agent. This enables otherwise insoluble or difficult to solubilize basic actives or basic benefit agents to be solubilized in the core.</p><p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">[0038] Suitable solubility enhancing agents for basic active agents or benefit agents include acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, acrylic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, alkanesulfonic acid, an amino acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, boric acid, butyric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, a fatty acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, hydroquinosulfonic acid, isoascorbic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, parabromophenylsulfonic acid, propionic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, thioglycolic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, uric acid and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">[0039] The liquid core is substantially free of preservatives. The liquid core may be completely free of preservatives.</p><p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">[0040] The liquid core may be a single phase (one-phase). Alternatively, the liquid core may comprise multiple phases, for example the liquid core may be an emulsion or a suspension, while at least one basic active agent is completely dissolved in the polar liquid as the continuous phase of the liquid core. Alternatively, for a liquid core composed of an emulsion, at least one basic active agent is completely dissolved in the liquids that make up the liquid core, namely the basic active agent in its dissolved form is distributed among the internal phase liquid (e.g., oil phase), and the external polar liquid phase (e.g., glycerol, polyglycerol, or other polyol phase) is the continuous phase of the liquid emulsion core.</p><p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">[0041] In one embodiment, the liquid core is a substantially, or completely uniform single phase, namely, it is a homogeneous clear liquid containing no visibly detectable inhomogeneities, such as suspended droplets or particles when viewed with the unaided human eye at a distance of approximately 12 inches. The liquid core as a single phase may contain other organic liquids besides the polar liquid, so long as such organic solvents are soluble or substantially soluble, miscible or substantially miscible in the polar liquid to maintain the homogeneity and clarity of the liquid core. When other organic liquids that are partially soluble in or partially miscible with the polar liquid are used, their amounts should be below their saturation concentrations to ensure the liquid core remains a clear solution.</p><p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">[0042] The polar liquid may comprise one or more polyols. Such polyols include, but are not limited to glycerol (glycerin), polyglycerols, glycols, polyglycols, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">[0043] Examples of polyglycerols include, but are not limited to diglycerol (diglycerin), triglycerol (polyglcerin-3 or polyglycerol-3), tetraglycerol (polyglycerin-4 or polyglycerol-4), other polyglycerols (polycerol-n, where n&gt;4), and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">[0044] Examples of glycols include, but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, butylene glycol and its isomers (e.g., 1,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol and 2,3-butanediol), hexylene glycol and its isomers, propanediol, dipropylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, methylpropanediol, isopentyldiol, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">[0045] Examples of polyglycols include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, namely, molecular weights ranging from 300 g/mol to Ser. No. 10/000,000 g/mol, (e.g., PEG-200, PEG-400, PEG-1000, PEG-2000 PEG-4000, PEG-6000), polypropylene glycol (PPG) of various molecular weights, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">[0046] The polar liquid may comprise a combination of a polyol with one or more other organic liquids. Such organic liquids include, but are not limited to alcohols, isosorbides, esters, ethers, lactones, and any organic compounds acceptable for therapeutic, cosmetic or personal product applications and capable of maintaining the percent surface polarity of the polar liquid at 24% or above.</p><p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">[0047] Examples of alcohols include, but are not limited to ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, octyldocanol, hexyldecanol, butyloctanol, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">[0048] Examples of isosorbides include, but are not limited to dimethyl isosorbide, diethyl isosorbide, ethylmethyl isosorbide, and mixtures thereof.

The amount of glycerol, polyglycerol, or mixture thereof may be about 50% to about 100%, or more than about 70%, or more than about 80%, or 85% or more, by weight of the polar liquid of the liquid core.

High shearing is not required for this step, as blending of miscible liquids does not require high energy. The liquid mixing for this step may be done with equipment such as blenders, lab scale mixers, or homogenizers. The sample may be heated in cases where an active agent contained therein requires higher temperature to dissolve in the liquid mixture. The resulting homogeneous liquid can be converted to a powder by mixing with the hydrophobic particles of the shell under high shear, such as with a blender or a rotor-stator mixer or other inline high rotational speed mixers. It is preferred to run the powderization step with all contents at room temperature or below.</p><p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">[0101] In the case of a liquid core comprising an emulsion, the ingredients of the liquid core, including immiscible liquids, and/or active agents, and emulsifiers are mixed together under high shear until an emulsion is formed. The mixing for this step may be done with equipment such as blenders or homogenizers. The sample may be heated in cases where the active agent requires a higher temperature to dissolve in the liquid. The resulting emulsion can be converted to a powder by mixing with the hydrophobic particles under high shear, such as with a blender or a rotor-stator mixer or other inline high rotational speed mixers. It is preferred to run the powderization step with all contents at room temperature or below.</p><p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">[0102] Methods of using high rotational speed mixers for powder-liquid mixing to prepare the core/shell compositions are known in the art. The energy of mixing should be high enough to break the liquid into fine droplets to be covered or encapsulated by the hydrophobic powder shell. L. Forny et. al. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInfluence of mixing characteristics for water encapsulation by self-assembling hydrophobic silica nanoparticles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Powder Technology 189, 2009, pages 263-269) describe the method and requirements for such preparation, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id=\"h-0009\" num=\"0000\">[0000] Use</p><p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">[0103] The powder comprising core/shell particles has great versatility in application, and can be used in many consumer and medical products for human and animal use such as ingestible compositions (such as tablets and capsules), topical compositions (such as creams, lotions, gels, shampoos, cleansers, powders patches, bandages, and masks for application to the skin or mucosal membranes), garments (such as undergarments, underwear, bras, shirts, pants, pantyhose, socks, head caps, facial masks, gloves, and mittens), linens (such as towels, pillow covers or cases and bed sheets), sanitizing products for household and clinical settings, microcides for plants, and devices (such as toothbrushes, dental flosses, periodontal implants or inserts, orthodontic braces, joint wraps/supports, buccal patches, ocular inserts or implants such as contact lenses, nasal implants or inserts, and contact lens cleaning products, wound dressings, diapers, sanitary napkins, wipes, tampons, rectal and vaginal suppositories, and in coatings or embedded surfaces on medical devices and other surfaces where antimicrobial or other beneficial effects are desired).</p><p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">[0104] The powder comprising core/shell particles can be incorporated onto fibers, nonwovens, hydrocolloids, adhesives, films, polymers, and other substrates.

The above liquid mixture was added into a high speed blender (e.g. Oster Blender model BCBG08). 8% of fumed silica (e.g. AEROSIL R812S, Evonik Degussa) was added at room temperature and the mixture was blended at the highest setting for about 10-20 seconds, yielding an off-white powder.</li></ul></li></ul></p><h4>Example 2</h4><h4>In Vitro Skin Permeation of 5% Minoxidil Compositions Through Human Cadaver Skin</h4><p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0152\">[0152] A skin penetration study evaluated the penetration of minoxidil into different skin layers for the inventive cream powder sample prepared as disclosed in Example 1 vs. a commercially available 5% minoxidil solution sample (Men\\'s Rogaine Extra Strength Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil solution)</p><p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0153\">[0153] A well-known Franz diffusion cell method (as taught in US20020006418 A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference) was used. Franz cells had a diameter of 0.5 cm<sup>2 </sup>and a volume of liquid receptor of 5 ml. A magnetic stirrer bar was added in the donor compartment. The liquid receptor was filled with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Air bubbles in the donor compartment were removed. The system was thermostated at 37&#176; C. above a magnetic stirrer to ensure the homogeneity of the liquid receptor during the experiment. A cadaver skin sample from a commercial tissue bank (Ohio Valley Tissue and Skin Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, dermatomed to approximately 0.4 mm) was cut to fit the glass diffusion cell and mounted skin on the Franz cell. A test sample of 20 microliters was applied on the skin surface. Samples were collected from the receptor compartment at scheduled time points of 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours.</p><p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0154\">[0154] At the end of the study the skin surface was washed with a cotton swab of liquid receptor (PBS). After washing, skin extraction was performed either on full skin or on separated skin layers of epidermis and dermis. Samples collected from the receptor compartment and from the skin extraction were analyzed for minoxidil levels with a Waters High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with the procedure listed below. The results are shown in Table 1. The final average minoxidil levels in different skin layers are reported in micrograms (\\xce\\xbcg) for 3 different replicates. A minoxidil mass balance study was also conducted and the % of recovery of minoxidil was better than 95% for both the control and the inventive formulation.</p><p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0155\">[0155] <table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"><colspec colname=\"offset\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"left\" /><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"28pt\" align=\"center\" /><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"center\" /><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"center\" /><colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"63pt\" align=\"center\" /><tr><td /><td namest=\"offset\" nameend=\"4\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 1</td></tr><tr><td /><td namest=\"offset\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td /><td /><td /><td>Powder-to-</td><td /></tr><tr><td /><td /><td>Commercial</td><td>liquid 5%</td><td /></tr><tr><td /><td /><td>5%</td><td>Minoxidil</td><td>Ratio of Minoxidil:</td></tr><tr><td /><td /><td>Minoxidil</td><td>Composition</td><td>Powder-to-</td></tr><tr><td /><td>Time</td><td>Solution</td><td>Example 1</td><td>liquid/Commercial</td></tr><tr><td /><td>(hr)</td><td>(microgram)</td><td>(microgram)</td><td>solution</td></tr><tr><td /><td namest=\"offset\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td /></tr><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"left\" /><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"28pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><colspec colname=\"5\" colwidth=\"63pt\" align=\"center\" /><tr><td>Cumulative</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</td></tr><tr><td>Minoxidil in</td><td>3</td><td>26.5</td><td>37.8</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Receptor</td><td>6</td><td>48.5</td><td>92.1</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Dermis</td><td>6</td><td>8.7</td><td>17.5</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Epidermis</td><td>6</td><td>14.8</td><td>18.9</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>Tapes</td><td>6</td><td>18.5</td><td>13.5</td><td>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</td></tr><tr><td>Wash</td><td>6</td><td>737.0</td><td>629.9</td><td>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>6</td><td>95.5</td><td>95.3</td><td>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</td></tr><tr><td>Recovered</td></tr><tr><td namest=\"1\" nameend=\"5\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr></table></p><p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0156\">[0156] Because the target tissue for topical minoxidil delivery is the hair follicles (hair \\xe2\\x80\\x9croots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) residing deep in the dermis, only minoxidil that penetrated into and cross the dermis layer could reach the hair follicles, and therefore, are of practical significance. It is surprising that the powder-to-liquid composition of the present invention has enhanced minoxidil delivery deep into the human skin significantly (i.e., by about 100% into the dermis which is where the hair bulb is located) in comparison to the commercial minoxidil solution of the same drug concentration, as demonstrated by the results in Table 1. This is an unexpected finding since the commercial minoxidil solution contains significant amount of two well known skin permeation enhancers, ethanol (30%) and propylene glycol (50%) whereas the powder-to-liquid composition of the present invention contains none of these skin permeation enhancers, but only glycerin. Glycerin is not generally regarded as a skin permeation enhancer.</p><p id=\"h-0030\" num=\"0000\">[0000] HPLC Procedure for Minoxidil Quantification</p><p id=\"p-0156\" num=\"0157\">[0157] A HPLC System (Waters Alliance\\xc2\\xae HPLC system) was used to measure minoxidil with UV absorption response at 286 nm.

The mice were shaved with a short hair clipper to hairless on their back (2\\xc3\\x975 cm<sup>2 </sup>area) at the start of the study. The test articles were applied to the shaved areas of the mice daily at 0.2 ml per dose. Both the hair anagen phase and the hair coverage were observed visually and recorded daily for each mouse\\'s hair condition (Telogen phase: resting phase in hair growth cycle\\xe2\\x80\\x94shaved

Most of the acne is seen in adolescents; however there can be a second recurrence of acne in people in their late twenties and early thirties, mostly in women.</p><p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">[0004] Acne is a systemic inflammatory disease, and may be exacerbated in puberty due to the release of hormones, as well as a pro-inflammatory diet. Dermatologists classify the primary event in acne as the formation of the microcomedo, i.e., the clogging of a follicle with what is believed to be non-inflamed lesions caused by retention hyperkeratosis. However, the hyperkeratinization of the follicle is not the primary event, but the result of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1) in the follicular wall, resulting in increased cohesion of the cells and a clogged pore. There also may be activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF&#954;B secondary to oxidative stress in the follicle. In addition, fatty acids within the follicle may be pro-inflammatory and may mimic active messengers similar to the pro-inflammatory platelet-activating factor.</p><p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">[0005] Another causative event is the stretching of the follicular wall, caused by the impaction of exfoliated keratinocytes. This stretching can release phospholipids from the cell walls, which are broken down into pro-inflammatory fatty acid messengers. Arachidonic acid also plays a part in the inflammation as well.</p><p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">[0006] Dermatologists typically use a grading system to categorize the various stages of the acne lesion. Grade One, the microcomedone, can appear as whiteheads or blackheads. Grade Two is a papule, i.e., a small pink inflamed bump. Grade Three is a pustule lesion with more visible inflammation than papule. Grade Four is a nodule or large painful solid lesion that extends deep into the skin. Grade Five is an inflamed lesion, very large and painful. It should be noted that as the follicle becomes impacted, it is often secondarily infected with propionibacteria.</p><h4>SUMMARY</h4><p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">[0007] The present invention generally relates to compositions and methods for transdermal drug delivery, including treatment of acne and other conditions.

FIG. 1 shows results from the laser Doppler assay in four human study participants.</p></description-of-drawings><h4>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h4><p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">[0014] The present invention generally relates to compositions and methods for treatment of subjects having or at risk of acne or other conditions. In some cases, the composition may include nitric oxide. The nitric oxide may be present within a first phase comprising a lecithin, such as phosphatidylcholine. In certain embodiments, the lecithin is present in liposomes, micelles, or other vesicles containing nitric oxide. The composition can take the form of a gel, a cream, a lotion, an ointment, a solution, a solid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc., that can be rubbed or sprayed onto the skin, e.g., onto a location with acne, or on another suitable portion of the skin. Other aspects of the present invention are generally directed to methods of making or using such compositions, methods of promoting such compositions, kits including such compositions, or the like.</p><p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">[0015] According to one aspect of the present invention, a composition as described herein is used to treat acne or other conditions. To \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a disorder means to reduce or eliminate a sign or symptom of the disorder, to stabilize the disorder, and/or to reduce or slow further progression of the disorder. Thus, in one set of embodiments, the application of nitric oxide, e.g., in a nitric oxide-containing matrix, to acne lesions and the surrounding skin may result in clinical improvement. In some cases, the delivery of nitric oxide to the skin, e.g., to the epidermis and/or dermis, may be achieved at a controlled rate and/or concentration. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that nitric oxide may block cytokine production, and therefore the primary event of interleukin-causing retention hyperkeratosis may be avoided. In addition, in some cases, the natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of nitric oxide may prevent the magnifying cascade that results in clinically apparent inflammatory lesions. Also, anti-microbial effects of nitric oxide may be used to clear follicles of secondary infection, e.g., from propionibacteria.</p><p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">[0016] In some embodiments, the nitric oxide in the composition is stable at room temperature, and may remain active for extended periods of time, e.g., at least 1 year, at least 1.5 years, at least 2 years, at least 2.5 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, etc. The nitric oxide may be released, for example, when the composition is exposed to an aqueous environment, e.g., within the body. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that when the composition is applied to the skin, the liquid crystal structure collapses, delivering nitric oxide to, e.g., an acne lesion or other desired area of treatment. The concentration of the nitric oxide inside the liquid crystal matrix can be varied in terms of concentration. The matrix also may act as a sustained release and delivery system in some embodiments. It is also believed that the liquid crystal is highly penetrating, such that nitric oxide can be delivered to the epidermis, dermis and dermal vascular for systemic release as well as to subcutaneous fat, at least under some conditions.</p><p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">[0017] Thus, in one set of embodiments, application of nitric oxide, e.g., in a penetrating matrix gel delivering the active nitric oxide, may act as a preventative of and/or be used to treat acne. In another set of embodiments, a composition as described herein is applied to the skin of a subject, e.g., one having or at risk of acne. For instance, in some embodiments, a composition as is described herein is contacted with the skin of a subject at a location where treatment of acne is desired.</p><p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">[0018] In some cases, the subject may be one that already has acne, e.g., located on the face, the chest, the back, etc. However, in other cases, the subject may not necessarily have acne, but may be one that is at risk of developing acne. For instance, the subject may be one that is an adolescent or soon to be an adolescent. In some cases, the subject may be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 years old. The subject may also be one that exhibits relatively oily skin, or increased production of sebum from the sebaceous glands (e.g., relative to the general population, or relative to the same subject at an earlier age). The subject may also be one with a family history of acne.</p><p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">[0019] In some cases, the application of nitric oxide, e.g., as discussed herein, may occur in conjunction with other systems and methods of acne treatment, e.g., using medications such as benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, retinoids, antiseborrheic medications, anti-androgen medications, hormonal treatments, salicylic acid, alpha hydroxy acid, azelaic acid, nicotinamide, keratolytic soaps, egg oil, tea tree oil, and/or aloe vera, and/or other treatments such as dermabrasion, phototherapy, laser treatments, deep penetrating light therapy, photodynamic therapy, or the like.</p><p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">[0020] In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, nitric oxide gas itself may be entrapped or contained within various compositions as discussed herein, for example, in liquid crystal multilamellar phosphatidylcholine. In addition, in certain embodiments as discussed below, the composition may be stable and can be stored for periods of time with little or no loss or reaction of the nitric oxide contained therein.</p><p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">[0021] Since nitric oxide is an unstable and reactive gas, entrapment, storage, and release of nitric oxide requires careful formulation in some embodiments of the invention. For example, nitric oxide readily reacts with water to form nitrous acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>), and thus, certain embodiments of the invention include compositions or phases that are substantially free of water. As another example, in one set of embodiments, nitric oxide may be contained within a first phase comprising a lecithin such as phosphatidylcholine, which may be present within a second phase comprising an emulsifier, such as is discussed herein. Other components, for example, transdermal penetration enhancers, adjuvants, surfactants, lubricants, etc. can also be present in certain cases.</p><p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">[0022] Thus, the compositions of the invention comprise, in certain aspects, a phase comprising phosphatidylcholine and/or other lecithins in which nitric oxide is contained within or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrapped.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be contained within a second phase, for example, comprising an emulsifier, which may cause the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin to form vesicles, e.g., micelles or liposomes. The phosphatidylcholine or lecithin composition can be unilamellar or multilamellar in some embodiments. In some instances, the presence of the second phase causes the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin to form a liquid crystal arrangement.</p><p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">[0023] The nitric oxide is typically gaseous, and may be present within the composition as small bubbles and/or bound to lecithins or phosphatidylcholines within the composition. For example, the nitric oxide may be bound to double bonds present in the lecithins or phosphatidylcholines. Phosphatidylcholine is believed to stabilize and/or contain the nitric oxide. In some cases, stability of the composition can be achieved at room temperature (about 25&#176; C.), and/or at other temperatures such as those described herein. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the phosphatidylcholine adopts a liquid crystal structure under such conditions, which can thereby contain the nitric oxide, e.g., as small gaseous bubbles, and/or through binding with lecithins or phosphatidylcholines.</p><p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">[0024] Nitric oxide is typically reactive with water (e.g., forming nitrous acid), which contributes to its relatively short lifetime within the body or within other aqueous environments. Accordingly, in certain embodiments of the invention, the composition, or at least a phase of the composition comprising the nitric oxide (and/or the second phase, and/or one or more materials used to prepare a nitric oxide composition, and/or a nitric oxide composition prepared as described herein), is substantially free of water, e.g., comprising no more than about 10 wt %, no more than about 3 wt %, no more than about 1 wt %, no more than about 0.3 wt %, or no more than about 0.1 wt % water (i.e., relative to the weight of the overall composition). The composition may also have no more than about 1,000 ppm, no more than about 750 ppm, no more than about 500 ppm, no more than about 400 ppm, no more than about 300 ppm, no more than about 250 ppm, no more than about 200 ppm, no more than about 150 ppm, no more than about 100 ppm, no more than about 50 ppm, no more than about 25 ppm, or no more than about 10 ppm of water. In certain embodiments, no detectable water may be present in the composition, or at least within a phase of the composition comprising the nitric oxide. Any suitable technique can be used for determining the amount of water present in the composition, for example, Karl-Fisher titration. In some cases, the composition may also be free of any liquids that typically contain water, e.g., physiological buffers, body fluids, saline, or the like.</p><p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">[0025] Any suitable amount of nitric oxide may be present within a composition prepared as described herein. For example, at least about 0.3 wt %, at least about 0.5 wt %, at least about 0.7 wt %, at least about 1 wt %, at least about 1.5 wt %, at least about 2 wt %, at least about 2.5 wt %, at least about 3 wt %, at least about 5 wt % at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 60 wt %, at least about 70 wt %, at least about 80 wt %, at least about 90 wt %, at least about 100 wt %, at least about 110 wt %, or at least about 120 wt % of the composition can be nitric oxide, where the basis of the weight percentage is the weight of the composition before nitric oxide is added. For example, the nitric oxide may be present at between 70 wt % and about 120 wt % of the composition. In some embodiments, the nitric oxide may be present at a concentration of at least about 400 mg/kg, at least about 450 mg/kg, at least about 500 mg/kg, at least about 550 mg/kg, at least about 570 mg/kg, at least about 600 mg/kg, at least about 650 mg/kg, at least about 700 mg/kg, at least about 750 mg/kg, at least about 800 mg/kg, at least about 850 mg/kg, at least about 950 mg/kg, or at least about 1000 mg/kg of the composition. In certain cases, the nitric oxide may be present at a concentration of no more than about 2000 mg/kg, no more than about 1500 mg/kg, no more than about 1000 mg/kg, no more than about 960 mg/kg, no more than about 900 mg/kg, no more than about 800 mg/kg, no more than about 700 mg/kg, or no more than about 600 mg/kg. For example, the nitric oxide may be present at a concentration of between about 570 mg/kg and about 960 mg/kg.</p><p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">[0026] In some embodiments, the nitric oxide is present at a concentration (e.g., on a per-mass basis) of at least about 100 ppm, at least about 200 ppm, at least about 300 ppm, at least about 400 ppm, at least about 500 ppm, at least about 600 ppm, at least about 700 ppm, at least about 800 ppm, at least about 900 ppm, at least about 1000 ppm, at least about 1100 ppm, at least about 1200 ppm, at least about 1300 ppm, at least about 1400 ppm, at least about 1500 ppm, at least about 1600 ppm, at least about 1700 ppm, at least about 1800 ppm, at least about 1900 ppm, at least about 2000 ppm, at least about 2500 ppm, at least about 3000 ppm, at least about 3500 ppm, at least about 4000 ppm, at least about 4500 ppm, at least about 5000 ppm, at least about 6000 ppm, at least about 7000 ppm, at least about 8000 ppm, at least about 9000 ppm, or at least about 10000 ppm of the composition. In other embodiments, the nitric oxide is present at a concentration of no more than about 11000 ppm, no more than about 10000 ppm, no more than about 9000 ppm, no more than about 8000 ppm, no more than about 7000 ppm, no more than about 6000 ppm, no more than about 5000 ppm, no more than about 4500 ppm, no more than about 4000 ppm, no more than about 3500 ppm, no more than about 3000 ppm, no more than about 2500 ppm, no more than about 2000 ppm, no more than about 1900 ppm, no more than about 1800 ppm, no more than about 1700 ppm, no more than about 1600 ppm, no more than about 1500 ppm, no more than about 1400 ppm, no more than about 1300 ppm, no more than about 1200 ppm, no more than about 1100 ppm, no more than about 1000 ppm, no more than about 900 ppm, no more than about 800 ppm, no more than about 700 ppm, no more than about 600 ppm, no more than about 500 ppm, no more than about 400 ppm, or no more than about 300 ppm of the composition. For example, in some embodiments, nitric oxide is present at a concentration of between about 400 and about 900 ppm. NO content can be measured by any suitable technique. For example, in some embodiments, NO content is measured using a nitric oxide biosensor (e.g., nitric oxide macrosensor with nitric oxide specific electrode from WPI Instruments). In some embodiments, NO content is measured by a change in weight in the composition after adding NO.</p><p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">[0027] In some embodiments, nitric oxide is present within a first phase comprising a lecithin, such as phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine (herein abbreviated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) is a basic component of cell membrane bilayers and the main phospholipid circulating in the plasma of blood. Phosphatidylcholine typically has a phospholipid structure with a choline head group and a glycerophosphoric acid tail group. The tail group can be saturated or unsaturated. More than one tail group may be present in the phosphatidylcholine in some cases, and the tail groups may be the same or different. Specific non-limiting examples of phosphatidylcholines that could be used include one or a mixture of stearic, palmitic, margaric, and/or oleic acid diglycerides linked to a choline ester head group.</p><p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">[0028] Phosphatidylcholines are a member of a class of compounds called lecithins. Typically, a lecithin is a composed of phosphoric acid, choline, fatty acids, glycerol, glycolipids, triglycerides, and/or phospholipids. In some cases, other lecithins may be used, in addition to or instead of a phosphatidylcholine. Non-limiting examples of other lecithins include phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidic acid. Many commercial lecithin products are available, such as, for example, Lecithol\\xc2\\xae, Vitellin\\xc2\\xae, Kelecin\\xc2\\xae, and Granulestin\\xc2\\xae. Lecithin is widely used in the food industry. In some embodiments, certain compositions of the invention can contain synthetic or natural lecithin, or mixtures thereof. Natural preparations are used in some cases because they exhibit desirable physical characteristics, and/or may be economical or nontoxic. However, in other embodiments, non-natural preparations are used, or the composition can include both natural and non-natural preparations.</p><p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">[0029] Any suitable amount of phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be present within the composition. For example, at least about 0.25 wt %, at least about 0.5 wt %, at least about 1 wt %, at least about 2 wt %, at least about 3 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 8 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 60 wt %, at least about 70 wt %, at least about 80 wt %, or at least about 90 wt % of the entire composition can be a phosphatidylcholine or a lecithin. In some cases, the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be present at a concentration of no more than about 95 wt %, no more than about 90 wt %, no more than about 80 wt %, no more than about 70 wt %, no more than about 65 wt %, no more than about 60 wt %, no more than about 50 wt %, no more than about 40 wt %, no more than about 30 wt %, no more than about 20 wt %, or no more than about 10%. For instance, the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be present at between about 8 wt % and about 65 wt %, or between about 0 wt % and about 10 wt %, etc. One or more than one type of phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be present.</p><p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">[0030] Some delivery compositions of the present invention may contain polyenylphosphatidylcholine (herein abbreviated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPPC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). In some cases, PPC can be used to enhance epidermal penetration. The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolyenylphosphatidylcholine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as used herein, means any phosphatidylcholine bearing two fatty acid moieties, wherein at least one of the two fatty acids is an unsaturated fatty acid with at least two double bonds in its structure, such as linoleic acid.</p><p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">[0031] Certain types of soybean lecithin and soybean fractions, for example, can contain higher levels of polyenylphosphatidylcholine, with dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (18:2-18:2 phosphatidylcholine) as the most abundant phosphatidylcholine species therein, than conventional food grade lecithin. Such lecithins may be useful in formulating certain delivery compositions. In some embodiments, conventional soybean lecithin may be enriched with polyenylphosphatidylcholine, for instance, by adding soybean extracts containing high levels of polyenylphosphatidylcholine. As used herein, this type of phosphatidylcholine is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolyenylphosphatidylcholine-enriched\\xe2\\x80\\x9d phosphatidylcholine (hereinafter referred to as PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine), even where the term encompasses lecithin obtained from natural sources exhibiting polyenylphosphatidylcholine levels higher than ordinary soybean varieties. These products are commercially available, for example, from American Lecithin Company, Rhone-Poulenc and other lecithin vendors. American Lecithin Company markets its products with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cU\\xe2\\x80\\x9d designation, indicating high levels of unsaturation; Rhone-Poulenc\\'\\'s product is a soybean extract containing about 42% dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine and about 24% palmitoyllinoleylphosphatidylcholine (16:0 to 18:2 of PC) as the major phosphatidylcholine components. Another example of a suitable polyenylphosphatidylcholine is NAT 8729 (also commercially available from vendors such as Rhone-Poulenc and American Lecithin Company).</p><p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">[0032] Any suitable amount of polyenylphosphatidylcholine may be present within the composition. For example, at least about 0.25 wt %, at least about 0.5 wt %, at least about 1 wt %, at least about 2 wt %, at least about 3 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 8 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 60 wt %, at least about 70 wt %, at least about 80 wt %, or at least about 90 wt % of the composition can be polyenylphosphatidylcholine. In some cases, the polyenylphosphatidylcholine may be present at a concentration of no more than about 95 wt %, no more than about 90 wt %, no more than about 80 wt %, no more than about 70 wt %, no more than about 65 wt %, no more than about 60 wt %, no more than about 50 wt %, no more than about 40 wt %, no more than about 30 wt %, no more than about 20 wt %, or no more than about 10%. For instance, the polyenylphosphatidylcholine may be present at between about 8 wt % and about 65 wt %. In some embodiments, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 60 wt %, at least about 70 wt %, at least about 80 wt %, at least about 90 wt %, or about 100 wt % of all of the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin in the composition is polyenylphosphatidylcholine.</p><p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">[0033] While not wishing to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine forms a bilayer enveloping nitric oxide (and in some embodiments, other adjunct ingredients, if present) to create the drug delivery composition. The PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine is believed to contribute to the stability of the nitric oxide, for example, by shielding the nitric oxide from water, and/or by enhancing its penetration into the skin or other area, e.g., a mucosal surface.</p><p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">[0034] The first phase also comprises, in some embodiments of the invention, a fatty acid ester. Non-limiting examples include ascorbate palmitate or isopropyl palmitate. In some cases, the fatty acid ester is used as a preservative or an antioxidant. The composition can include any suitable amount of fatty acid ester, for example, at least about 1 wt %, at least about 3 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, etc. In some cases, no more than about 60 wt %, no more than about 50 wt %, no more than about 40 wt %, no more than about 30 wt %, no more than about 20 wt %, no more than about 18 wt %, no more than about 15 wt %, no more than about 12 wt %, or no more than about 10 wt % of the composition is fatty acid ester. For example, the composition may be between about 0 wt % and about 10 wt % fatty acid ester. The composition may include one or more than one fatty acid ester.</p><p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">[0035] In certain embodiments, a drug delivery composition such as those described herein can be formulated to include a second phase. Typically, the second phase is substantially immiscible with the first phase comprising phosphatidylcholine or lecithin. Two phases that are substantially immiscible are able to form discrete phases when exposed to each other at ambient conditions (e.g., 25&#176; C. and 1 atm) for extended periods of time (e.g., at least about a day). The phases can be separate identifiable phases (e.g., one may float above the other), or in some cases, the phases are intermingled, e.g., as in an emulsion. The stability of the discrete phases may be kinetic and/or thermodynamic in nature, in various embodiments.</p><p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">[0036] In one set of embodiments, the second phase may comprise an emulsifier which causes the first phase comprising phosphatidylcholine or lecithin to form a liquid crystal, and/or vesicles such as micelles or liposomes. Typically, in a liquid crystal phase, vesicular structures such as micelles, liposomes, hexagonal phases, or lipid bilayers can be formed. In some cases, multilamellar structures may be present within the liquid crystal phase, although in other cases, only unilamellar structures may be present. For example, in certain cases, the PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine can be loosely arranged in a multilamellar fashion, with nitric oxide and optional adjunct ingredients being bonded or otherwise entrapped or contained within the lipid bilayers formed therein. In some cases, the first phase (e.g., comprising PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine) and the second phase can form a structure such as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,182,956 to Perricone, et al. This is believed (without wishing to be bound by any theory) to form a loosely arranged, yet stable, PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine-drug complex that may allow penetration and delivery of nitric oxide and optional adjunct ingredients to the skin, e.g., to the dermal vasculature.</p><p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">[0037] In one set of embodiments, the second phase comprises an emulsifier. The emulsifier, in one embodiment, is a substance that is able to stabilize an emulsion by increasing its kinetic stability. The emulsifier may also be chosen in some cases to be relatively inert or non-toxic relative to the skin.</p><p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">[0038] In some embodiments, the second phase may comprise a polyglycol. The polyglycol may include a polyhydric alcohol of a monomeric glycol such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and/or polypropylene glycol (PPG). For example, the PEG or PPG may be PEG or PPG 200, 300, 400, 600, 1,000, 1,450, 3,350, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, and 20,000, where the number indicates the approximate average molecular weight of the PEG or PPG. As is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, a polyglycol composition often will comprise a range of molecular weights, although the approximate average molecular weight is used to identify the type polyglycol. More than one PEG and/or PPG can also be present in certain instances.</p><p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">[0039] The second phase may comprise a surfactant in some embodiments. Non-limiting examples of surfactants include a siloxylated polyether comprising dimethyl, methyl(propylpolyethylene oxide propylene oxide, acetate) siloxane commercially available from vendors such as Dow Corning (Dow Corning 190 surfactant). Other examples of materials that can be used as (or within) the second phase include, but are not limited to, 1,2-propanediol, or silicone fluids containing low viscosity polydimethylsiloxane polymers, methylparaben (p-hydroxy benzoic acid methyl ester) commercially available from vendors such as Dow Corning (Dow Corning 200 silicone fluid). Still other examples include various siloxane or silicone compounds, e.g., hexamethyldisiloxane, amodimethicone, phenyltrimethicone, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">[0040] Additionally, purified water may be added to the second phase in some embodiments, although in other cases, little or no water is present in the second phase. For example, the first phase, the second phase, can contain less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 2%, less than 1%, or less that 0.05% (e.g., wt %) of water relative to the weight of the respective phase or of the entire composition. In some cases, the second phase may also comprise adjunct ingredients such as those described herein.</p><p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">[0041] The second phase may include any one, or more than one, of the materials described above. In addition, any suitable amount of second phase can be used in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. For example, the second phase may be present at at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 60 wt %, at least about 70 wt %, at least about 80 wt %, or at least about 90 wt % of the composition. In some cases, the ratio of the first phase (e.g., comprising phosphatidylcholine or lecithin) to the second phase can be at least about 1:3, at least about 1:2, at least about 1:1, at least about 2:1, at least about 3:1, or at least about 4:1, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">[0042] In another set of embodiments, the composition may also include one or more transdermal penetration enhancers. Examples of transdermal penetration enhancers include, but are not limited to, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone or 1,2-propanediol. Other examples include cationic, anionic, or nonionic surfactants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxamers, etc.); fatty acids and alcohols (e.g., ethanol, oleic acid, lauric acid, liposomes, etc.); anticholinergic agents (e.g., benzilonium bromide, oxyphenonium bromide); alkanones (e.g., n-heptane); amides (e.g., urea, N,N-dimethyl-m-toluamide); organic acids (e.g., citric acid); sulfoxides (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide); terpenes (e.g., cyclohexene); ureas; sugars; carbohydrates or other agents. The transdermal penetration enhancers can be present in any suitable amount within the composition. For example, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, or at least about 50 wt % of the composition may comprise one or more transdermal penetration enhancers. In some cases, no more than about 60 wt %, no more than about 50 wt %, no more than about 40 wt %, no more than about 30 wt %, no more than about 20 wt %, no more than about 10 wt %, no more than about 9 wt %, or no more than about 5 wt % of the composition comprises transdermal penetration enhancers. For example, the composition may have between about 0 wt % and about 5 wt % of one or more transdermal penetration enhancers.</p><p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">[0043] In other embodiments, the composition may be modified in order to control depth of penetration. For example, in certain embodiments, the composition includes one or more polymers that act to reduce penetration depth of nitric oxide. Controlled depth of penetration may be important for indications where local administration is desired without systemic effects. Examples of transdermal penetration barrier polymers include, but are not limited to, silicone waxes, acrylate polymers, and dimethicone copolymers. In certain embodiments, a transdermal penetration barrier polymer is nonionic. A transdermal penetration barrier polymer can be present in any suitable amount within the composition. For example, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 20 wt %, at least about 30 wt %, at least about 40 wt %, or at least about 50 wt % of the composition may comprise one or more transdermal penetration barrier polymers. In some cases, no more than about 60 wt %, no more than about 50 wt %, no more than about 40 wt %, no more than about 30 wt %, no more than about 20 wt %, no more than about 10 wt %, no more than about 9 wt %, or no more than about 5 wt % of the composition comprises a transdermal penetration barrier polymer. For example, the composition may have between about 0 wt % and about 5 wt % of one or more transdermal penetration barrier polymers.</p><p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">[0044] As a specific non-limiting example of one set of embodiments, a polyenylphosphatidylcholine comprises a certain material with the trade name NAT 8729, and optionally at least one polyglycol (polyhydric alcohol of a monomeric glycol such as polyethylene glycol 200, 300, 400, 600, 1,000, 1,450, 3,350, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000 and 20,000). The composition can also comprise a PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine material that is present within the first or second phase, e.g., comprising nitric oxide. The second phase may also comprise a surfactant such as a siloxylated polyether comprising dimethyl, methyl(propylpolyethylene oxide propylene oxide, acetate) siloxane commercially available from vendors such as Dow Corning (Dow Corning 190 surfactant) and lubricant such as silicone fluids containing low viscosity polydimethylsiloxane polymers, methylparaben (p-hydroxy benzoic acid methyl ester) commercially available from vendors such as Dow Corning (Dow Corning 200 silicone fluid).</p><p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">[0045] In some embodiments, various compositions of the invention are formulated to be substantially clear or substantially transparent. Transparency may be useful, for instance, for product acceptance in the marketplace, e.g., when applied to the skin of a subject. However, in other embodiments, the composition is not necessarily transparent. Certain substances can be useful in providing a substantially transparent composition, for example, fatty acid esters such as ascorbate palmitate or isopropyl palmitate. In one set of embodiments, the composition may be substantially transparent such that incident visible light (e.g., have wavelengths of between about 400 nm and about 700 nm) can be transmitted through 1 cm of the composition with a loss in intensity of no more than about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, or about 90% relative to the incident light. In some embodiments, there may be no substantial difference in the wavelengths that are absorbed by the composition (i.e., white light passing through the composition appears white), although in other cases, there can be more absorption at various wavelengths (for example, such that white light passing through the composition may appear colored).</p><p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">[0046] Other components may also be present within the composition, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. For example, the composition may include volatile organic fluids, fatty acids, volatile aromatic cyclic compounds, high molecular weight hydrocarbons, or the like.</p><p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">[0047] In accordance with certain aspects of the invention, the composition may be prepared by mixing a first phase and a second phase together, then passing nitric oxide through the mixture. As discussed above, the second phase can comprise an emulsifier, or any other components discussed herein. The first phase may comprise a lecithin such as phosphatidylcholine and/or polyenylphosphatidylcholine, e.g., PPC-enriched phosphatidylcholine, for instance, as described herein. In some embodiments, other components are also mixed into the composition, before or after (or while) adding nitric oxide, for example, transdermal penetration enhancers, adjuvants, polyglycols (e.g., PEG and/or PPG), surfactants, lubricants, etc. as discussed herein. In some embodiments, however, nitric oxide may be passed through the first phase prior to mixing of the first phase with the second phase.</p><p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">[0048] In one set of embodiments, after forming the mixture, nitric oxide can be passed into or through the mixture, for example, by blowing bubbles of nitric oxide through the mixture. Nitric oxide may be delivered into the mixture under pressures such as between about 3,000 Pa and about 15,000 Pa, between about 5,000 Pa and about 10,000 Pa, or between about 6,000 Pa and about 8,000 Pa, and/or temperatures such as between about 0&#176; C. and about 50&#176; C., between about 20&#176; C. and about 35&#176; C., or about 25&#176; C. and about 30&#176; C. However, higher or lower pressures also may be used in some embodiments as aspects of the invention are not limited in this respect.</p><p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">[0049] In certain embodiments, the nitric oxide is bubbled through the mixture until the mixture begins to at least partially solidify. As an example, the viscosity of the mixture may increase to at least about 1,000 cP, at least about 2,000 cP, at least about 3,000 cP, at least about 5,000 cP, at least about 7,000 cP, at least about 10,000 cP, at least about 12,000 cP, at least about 15,000 cP, at least about 20,000 cP, at least about 30,000 cP, at least about 40,000 cP, at least about 50,000 cP, at least about 60,000 cP, at least about 70,000 cP, or at least about 80,000 cP. The nitric oxide can be passed through the mixture as pure nitric oxide, and/or with other gases (e.g., a noble gas, for example, argon). In some cases, a nitric oxide donor may be passed into the mixture, and therein, at least some of the nitric oxide donor can be converted into nitric oxide. In other embodiments, however, the final composition may have lower viscosities, for example, such that the composition is liquid, or could be sprayed onto the skin.</p><p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">[0050] In one set of embodiments, the nitric oxide can be bubbled through the mixture to cause the viscosity of the mixture to increase. For example, the viscosity can increase until the mixture begins to form a gel, a cream, a lotion, an ointment, a solid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the like. A cream may be, for example, a semi-solid emulsion, e.g., comprising a first phase and a second phase. The first phase may be discontinuous (e.g., comprising small droplets or vesicles, such as is discussed herein) and the second phase may be continuous, or vice versa. In some cases, however, both the first phase and the second phase are co-continuous within the mixture.</p><p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">[0051] In some embodiments of the invention, a composition may be prepared as discussed above, then diluted, e.g., with a diluent, to produce a final composition. For example, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d composition may be initially prepared, e.g., having a relatively high nitric oxide concentration, then the stock composition diluted to produce a final composition, e.g., before use, before storage, before packaging, etc. In some embodiments, the diluent used may be a component as discussed herein (for example, forming at least a portion of the second phase), and the same or different materials than may be present in the initial composition may be used. The dilution ratio (amount of diluent added, relative to the initial composition) may be at least about 2, at least about 3, at least about 5, at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, at least about 30, at least about 50, or at least about 100, or any other suitable factor.</p><p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">[0052] A composition may be prepared and/or stored at any suitable temperature and under any suitable conditions. In some embodiments, for instance, a composition can be prepared and/or stored under limited or no oxygen conditions, as oxygen can adversely react with nitric oxide. The composition can also be prepared and/or stored under limited or no nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide, as both can also react adversely with nitric oxide. For instance, the composition may be prepared and/or stored in a sealed environment (e.g., stored in a sealed container). The sealed environment (e.g., container) can be at least substantially devoid of gas, and/or contains a gaseous mixture that excludes, or at least is depleted in, oxygen. In some embodiments, an environment depleted in oxygen may have less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, about 1% or less, about 0.1% or less, about 0.01% or less, about 0.001% or less, oxygen (e.g., as a wt % or as molar % per volume). For example, the gaseous mixture may include a noble gas, such as argon, helium, neon, etc. In one set of embodiments, the container may comprise a multi-layered metallic and/or polymeric barrier, e.g., formed from Glaminate\\xc2\\xae (American Can Company). For instance, the container may have the shape of a tube. Thus, in certain embodiments, the container is substantially resistant to oxygen permeation, nitrogen permeation, and/or carbon dioxide permeation. In certain embodiments, the container is substantially watertight, for example, such that substantially no water is absorbed by the container, or such that no water is able to pass through the container even if the container is filled with water.</p><p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">[0053] As previously discussed, nitric oxide can react with water, and thus, compositions described herein may be prepared and/or stored under conditions where substantially no water is present. For example, nitric oxide and/or a nitric oxide containing preparation described herein may be prepared and/or stored under relatively low relative humidities (e.g., less than about 50% RH, less than about 40% RH, less than about 30% RH, less than about 20% RH, or less than about 10% RH), and/or in the presence of a suitable desiccant, such as phosphorous pentoxide or silica gel.</p><p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">[0054] In certain embodiments, the mixture may be mixed with or otherwise include adjunct ingredients, if applicable, and nitric oxide may be introduced to the mixture, e.g., bubbles of nitric oxide gas may be blown into the mixture until the mixture hardens to obtain the desired final composition. As a specific non-limiting example, a nitric oxide composition may be formed by preparing a non-liposome multilamellar liquid crystal phosphatidylcholine phase, for example, by providing a polyglycol, then introducing phosphatidyl choline into the glycol at room temperature to form a phosphatidylcholine solution. The phosphatidylcholine often comes as a solid (e.g., as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrick\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of material), and the phosphatidylcholine may be broken down into smaller pieces to aid in mixing, e.g., by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshaving\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or grinding the phosphatidylcholine solid. The phosphatidylcholine solution is mixed until the phosphatidylcholine solution is substantially clear, then one may warm the phosphatidylcholine solution to 40&#176; C., mill the warmed solution (i.e., low agitation after the initial mixing), combine siloxylated polyether and polydimethylsiloxane to form a fluid, add the fluid to the warmed solution and milling until the solution is clear, adding methyl paraben or other suitable lubricant to the solution and milling until the methyl paraben dissolves in the solution, warm water to 40&#176; C. and adding the warmed water slowly to the solution, and then ceasing milling of the solution and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csweeping\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the solution (e.g., with a sweep mixer) to cool to room temperature. Nitric oxide gas can then be bubbled or otherwise introduced into the solution while cooling the solution until the solution begins to harden or becomes stiff, e.g., having the consistency of a gel or a cream, such as previously described. In some cases, the resulting composition is sealed in a container, for example, as discussed herein. Any suitable container may be used, e.g., a tube or a bottle. In addition, the composition (e.g., within the container) may be stored at room temperature, or any other suitable temperature. For example, a composition of the invention may be stored at or below 80&#176; C., e.g., at or below room temperature (about 25&#176; C.) or in a refrigerator (e.g., at 4&#176; C.) for extended period of storage, for instance, to prevent nitric oxide leakage or denaturing. In some cases, storage may extend for at least about a week, at least about 4 weeks, at least about 6 months, at least about a year, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">[0055] It is surprising that, according to some embodiments, nitric oxide not only can be entrapped in phosphatidylcholine or lecithin compositions such as those described herein, but also that such entrapped compositions may have a long shelf life, especially when refrigerated. No loss or reaction of nitric oxide is expected during extended refrigerated storage, at least under certain conditions. For instance, in certain embodiments, the composition may be stored at temperatures of less than about 80&#176; C., less than about 70&#176; C., less than about 60&#176; C., less than about 50&#176; C., less than about 40&#176; C., less than about 30&#176; C., less than about 25&#176; C., less than about 20&#176; C., less than about 15&#176; C., less than about 10&#176; C., less than about 5&#176; C., less than about 0&#176; C., etc., for extended periods of time, e.g., at least about a day, at least about a week, at least about 4 weeks, at least about 6 months, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">[0056] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that nitric oxide forms reversible physical bonds, similar to hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces, with phosphatidylcholine or other lecithin molecules, e.g., containing one or more double bonds, which may allow nitric oxide to become entrapped and thereby remain intact for an extended period of time, e.g., during storage. These physical bonds, however, are believed to be not very stable, and may in some cases be easily broken up, for example, upon various physical agitations such as rubbing the composition against the skin, thereby releasing the entrapped nitric oxide. While others have stabilized other substances or drugs within phosphatidylcholine or lecithin compositions or vesicles, for example, protein drugs such as insulin, it is surprising that a small, highly reactive molecule such as NO could similarly be stabilized, especially when it would have been expected that a molecule as small as NO would readily diffuse away from such compositions and/or would have reacted with water that is typically present within such compositions.</p><p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">[0057] In some embodiments, it is believed that other species reactive with water could also be similarly stabilized, e.g., within a composition as herein described. Any species that ordinarily reacts with water could be stabilized within such compositions. Examples of such species include, but are not limited to, lithium, or drugs or polymers with labile bonds susceptible to hydrolysis, for instance, certain peptides, polysaccharides, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">[0058] In certain aspects of the invention, a composition such as those described herein can be administered to a subject, such as a human subject, by rubbing it on the skin of the subject, e.g., in areas located at or at least within the vicinity of a desired target area. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that phosphatidylcholine provides or facilitates delivery of nitric oxide to the skin, allowing nitric oxide to be delivered to a target area. In some embodiments, the composition can be applied, by rubbing the composition topically against the skin, which allows the composition (or at least, nitric oxide) to be absorbed by the skin. The composition can be applied once, or more than once. For example, the composition may be administered at predetermined intervals. In some embodiments, for instance, the composition may be applied once per day, twice per day, 3 times per day, 4 times per day, once every other day, once every three days, once every four days, etc. The amount of nitric oxide necessary to bring about the therapeutic treatment is not fixed per se, and may depend upon factors such as the desired outcome, the type and severity the disease or condition, the form of nitric oxide, the concentration of nitric oxide present within the composition, etc.</p><p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">[0059] Thus, another aspect of the invention provides methods of administering any composition such as discussed herein to a subject. The compositions of the invention may be applied to a subject for local or systemic delivery, depending on the application. The compositions of the invention may also be applied to any suitable area of the skin. For example, the compositions may be applied to the upper chest or arms, or to any hairy or non-hairy portion of the skin, e.g., to promote systemic delivery of nitric oxide, or the composition may be applied locally, e.g., at an area of the skin where treatment is desired.</p><p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">[0060] When administered, the compositions of the invention are applied in a therapeutically effective, pharmaceutically acceptable amount as a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation. Any of the compositions of the present invention may be administered to the subject in a therapeutically effective dose. When administered to a subject, effective amounts will depend on the particular condition being treated and the desired outcome. A therapeutically effective dose may be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, for instance, employing factors such as those described herein and using no more than routine experimentation.</p><p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">[0061] In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to have a measurable positive effect on blood flow and/or vasodilation, and/or a measurable negative effect on blood pressure. In some embodiments, the effect on blood flow and/or vasodilation is observed local to the site of topical application. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to have a measurable effect on acne as evidenced by an appropriate clinical parameter, e.g., percent change in inflammatory acne lesion counts, percent change in non inflammatory acne lesion count, percent change in total acne lesion counts). In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to obtain a systemic level of nitric oxide that is sufficient to have a desired effect, e.g., have a measurable positive effect on blood flow and/or vasodilation, have a measurable negative effect on blood pressure, and/or have a measurable effect on acne as evidenced by an appropriate clinical parameter.</p><p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">[0062] The compositions described herein can be used in combination therapy with one or more additional therapeutic agents. For combination treatment with more than one active agent, where the active agents are in separate dosage formulations, the active agents may be administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the administration of the other agent. In certain embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is present in a provided composition in addition to nitric oxide. In other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is administered separately from the nitric oxide containing composition.</p><p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">[0063] When co-administered with other agents, e.g., when co-administered with another anti-acne medication, an \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceffective amount\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the second agent will depend on the type of drug used. Suitable dosages are known for approved agents and can be adjusted by the skilled artisan according to the condition of the subject, the type of condition(s) being treated and the amount of a compound described herein being used. In cases where no amount is expressly noted, an effective amount should be assumed. For example, compounds described herein can be administered to a subject in a dosage range from between about 0.01 to about 10,000 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 5000 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 3000 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 1000 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 500 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 300 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight/day.</p><p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">[0064] In one set of embodiments, the dosage may be between about 0.01 mg and about 500 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 300 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 100 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 30 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 10 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 3 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 1 g, between about 0.01 mg and about 300 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 100 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 30 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 10 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 3 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 1 mg, between about 0.01 mg and about 0.3 mg, or between about 0.01 mg and about 0.1 mg.</p><p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">[0065] In certain embodiments, a nitric oxide containing composition as described herein, and the additional therapeutic agent are each administered in an effective amount (i.e., each in an amount which would be therapeutically effective if administered alone). In other embodiments, a nitric oxide containing composition as described herein, and the additional therapeutic agent are each administered in an amount which alone does not provide a therapeutic effect (a sub-therapeutic dose). In yet other embodiments, a nitric oxide containing composition as described herein can be administered in an effective amount, while the additional therapeutic agent is administered in a sub-therapeutic dose. In still other embodiments, a nitric oxide containing composition as described herein can be administered in a sub-therapeutic dose, while the additional therapeutic agent is administered in an effective amount.</p><p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">[0066] As used herein, the terms \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin combination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cco-administration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be used interchangeably to refer to the use of more than one therapy (e.g., one or more prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents). The use of the terms does not restrict the order in which therapies (e.g., prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject.</p><p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">[0067] Co-administration encompasses administration of the first and second amounts of the compounds in an essentially simultaneous manner, such as in a single pharmaceutical composition, for example, capsule or tablet having a fixed ratio of first and second amounts, or in multiple, separate capsules or tablets for each. In addition, such co-administration also encompasses use of each compound in a sequential manner in either order. When co-administration involves the separate administration of the first amount of a composition as described herein, and a second amount of an additional therapeutic agent, the compounds are administered sufficiently close in time to have the desired therapeutic effect. For example, the period of time between each administration which can result in the desired therapeutic effect, can range from minutes to hours and can be determined taking into account the properties of each compound. For example, a composition as described herein, and the second therapeutic agent can be administered in any order within about 24 hours of each other, within about 16 hours of each other, within about 8 hours of each other, within about 4 hours of each other, within about 1 hour of each other or within about 30 minutes of each other.</p><p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">[0068] More specifically, a first therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such as a composition described herein) can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapy to a subject.</p><p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">[0069] Examples of therapeutic agents that may be combined with a composition of this disclosure, either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to, topical antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, metronidazole), oral antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, erythromycin, minocycline, doxycycline, clindamycin), topical retinoids (e.g., adapalene, tazarotene, tretinoin), oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin) benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, azelaic acid, and antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof (e.g., lipohexapeptide HB1345, oligopeptide-10, magainins (e.g., pexiganan), protegrins (e.g., iseganan), indolicidins (e.g., omiganan, MBI 594AN), histatins (e.g., P113 P113D), human bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins (e.g., XMP.629, neuprex), cathelicidins (e.g., cathelicidin-BF)).</p><p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">[0070] In certain embodiments of the invention, the administration of various compositions of the invention may be designed so as to result in sequential exposures to the composition over a certain time period, for example, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.

In some embodiments, a provided composition is not applied to the skin of a subject on or near a male or female genital region to treat sexual dysfunction and/or to enhance sexual performance or experience. In some embodiments, a provided composition is not applied to the perineal region (e.g., penis), or to the vulva of a subject.</p><p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">[0073] In some embodiments, provided compositions are not used to promote wound healing. In certain embodiments, a subject of the methods described herein does not suffer from a wound. In certain embodiments, a provided composition is not applied to a wound. Examples of wounds include cuts, scrapes, other traumatic wounds, burns or other accidental wounds, e.g., an anal fissure, a surgical site, a trauma site, a burn, an abrasion, a sunburn, a cut or laceration on the skin, or any other damaged region of the skin. In some embodiments, the composition is not applied to a mucosal surface of the subject, for example, to the nose. In certain embodiments, provided compositions are not used to treat wounds that result from surgical intervention (e.g., any medical intervention or operation that requires wound healing as part of the recovery process). In some embodiments, a composition of the invention is not used to prepare a tissue site for wound healing prior to the wound (e.g., prior to surgery) and/or after the wound (e.g., and/or after surgery). In some embodiments, a composition of the invention is not applied to the surface of a wound or to skin prior to a wound.</p><p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">[0074] In some embodiments, a composition of the invention is not applied to a surgical device, tool, or other substrate, such as sutures, implants, surgical tools, surgical dressings, bandages, or other substrates that may come into contact with wounded tissue during surgery.

In some cases, administration of a composition and delivery of nitric oxide as discussed herein is easier and more effective than other drug administration routes, for example, oral delivery. Unlike oral administration where a substantial amount of nitric oxide may be destroyed during the digestive process, nitric oxide delivered topically is not exposed to the digestive tract. Topical application may also allow, in some instances, relatively steady delivery of nitric oxide to the desired target area without the cyclic dosages typical of orally or parenterally administered drugs. In some embodiments, topical application may also avoid toxic side effects associated with sustained increased levels of nitric oxide typical of oral or parenteral administration.</p><p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">[0077] Compared to other topical delivery systems that employ nitric oxide donors (an entity that is able to release nitric oxide, such as L-arginine, nitroglycerin, or amyl nitrite) as a nitric oxide source, various aspects of the present invention utilizing nitric oxide gas have several advantages, including one or more of the following. Nitric oxide can be released relatively quickly in some embodiments, because the release does not necessarily involve chemical transformations of nitric oxide donors to release nitric oxide. The concentration of nitric oxide can accumulate quickly upon topical administration, leading to good therapeutic effect in certain embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, the release rate of nitric oxide can be controlled, for instance, by physical actions (e.g., by controlling how much of the composition is applied to the skin), in comparison to nitric oxide donors which release nitric oxide upon chemical stimulation. Moreover, certain embodiments of the present invention employ phosphatidylcholine, a component of cell membranes, as a carrier which improves the penetration and absorption of nitric oxide into cells and tissues. Thus, certain compositions of the present invention will be non-toxic or biocompatible.</p><p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">[0078] The compositions of the present invention may additionally comprise one or more adjunct ingredients, for instance, pharmaceutical drugs, skin care agents, and/or excipients. For example, compositions of the invention may include additional ingredients such as salts, buffering agents, diluents, excipients, chelating agents, fillers, drying agents, antioxidants, antimicrobials, preservatives, binding agents, bulking agents, silicas, solubilizers, or stabilizers. Non-limiting examples include species such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, kaolin, calcium phosphate, or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding agents such as starch, gelatin or acacia; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc; time-delay materials such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol distearate; suspending agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or other naturally-occurring phosphatides; thickening agents such as cetyl alcohol or beeswax; buffering agents such as acetic acid and salts thereof, citric acid and salts thereof, boric acid and salts thereof, or phosphoric acid and salts thereof; or preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, parabens, or thimerosal. Suitable concentrations can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, using no more than routine experimentation. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable formulation ingredients, or will be able to ascertain such, using only routine experimentation.</p><p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">[0079] Preparations can include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions, which can be isotonic with the blood of the subject in certain embodiments. Examples of nonaqueous solvents are polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oil such as olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, arachis oil, peanut oil, mineral oil, organic esters such as ethyl oleate, or fixed oils including synthetic mono or di-glycerides. Aqueous solvents include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, 1,3-butandiol, Ringer\\'\\'s dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer\\'\\'s or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer\\'\\'s dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases and the like. Those of skill in the art can readily determine the various parameters for preparing and formulating the compositions of the invention without resort to undue experimentation.</p><p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">[0080] In one set of embodiments, the efficacy of various compositions of the invention as applied to a subject may be determined or monitored by studying the carotid arteries, which generally supply the head and neck with blood. For example, in certain embodiments, a composition of the invention may be applied to a subject for systemic delivery, and one effect of the nitric oxide may be to cause vasodilation. By studying the carotid artery, the effect of the nitric oxide delivery may be monitored, and if necessary, the dosing of nitric oxide adjusted. Any suitable method may be used to monitor the carotid artery, e.g., ultrasound, a carotid Doppler machine, functional MRI, PET scanning, etc. In other embodiments, if local delivery without systemic effects is desired, the carotid artery can be monitored for any systemic effects.</p><p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">[0081] In one aspect, one or more compositions described herein may be formulated for oral delivery.

An accurate amount of a carrier (HNC 167-62) (see below) was introduced into a system. The carrier weight used in these experiments was approximately 250 g and the vessel size was 500 ml. The vessel was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, and gas outlet and was previously purged with argon for about an hour. The temperature of the carrier was kept at about 25-30&#176; C. NO gas regulated at 5 psi (1 psi is about 6,900 Pa) and was then introduced at a controlled rate of about 1 bubble/s with continuous stirring. The color, consistency, and viscosity of the carrier did not appear to change if NO was bubbled for 30 minutes to 2 hours. After 6 hours, the weight of the carrier had increased by 0.15%, by 12 hours by 0.25%, and by 24 hours by 0.56%. These increases in weight were believed to be significant considering the relative small molecular weight of NO versus the carrier. Although there was a slight change in color during the experiment (the color changed to slightly more orange), IR spectrum analysis of the final product did not show any change versus the initial carrier, indicating no noticeable chemical change in the carrier. The carrier also can solidify upon cooling if the carrier is initially a solid at lower temperature. Accordingly, this example demonstrates that a composition containing NO can be prepared in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><h4>Example 2</h4><p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">[0087] In this example, six experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction of nitric oxide with three carriers (HNC 157-62, HNC 157-65, and HNC 157-69) as well as with 1,3-propanediol, using experimental conditions similar to that described for Example 1. In addition three experiments were performed to prepare carriers containing 800 ppm and 500 ppm nitric oxide. HNC 157-62 was formed of 65% Phospholipon-90G (American Lecithin Company), 18% isopropyl palmitate (Kraft Chemicals), 8% capric caprylic triglycerides (RITA Corp.), and 9% propanediol (Dupont). HNC 157-65 was formed of 65% Phospholipon-90G, 13% isopropyl palmitate, 14% capric caprylic triglycerides, 3% propanediol, and 5% dimethyl isosorbide (Croda). HNC 157-69 was formed from 65% Phospholipon-90G, 16% isopropyl palmitate, and 19% capric caprylic triglycerides.</p><p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">[0088] The compositions were generally prepared as follows. Isopropyl palmitate, capric caprylic triglyceride, propanediol (for HNC 157-62 and HNC 157-65), and dimethyl isosorbide (for HNC 157-65) were mixed together and warmed to 40&#176; C. Phospholipon-90G was then gradually added to this liquid mixture by mixing it. Phospholipon-90G is typically received as individual pellets, and is mixed into the solution until fully dissolved. The mixture was subsequently filtered through a sieve to remove any undissolved Phospholipon-90G.</p><p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">[0089] Accordingly, the HNC carriers included 1,3-propanediol, Phospholipon-90G, isopropyl palmitate, capric and/or caporic triglycerides, and Arlasolve DMI (ICI America or Croda). Isopropyl palmitate, the capric and/or caporic triglycerides, and Arlasolve DMI are expected to be chemically inert towards nitric oxide, while the literature suggests that 1,2-propanediol and glycerol may be able to react with nitric oxide gas to form mononitrates. Accordingly, it would be expected that 1,3-propanediol may also react with NO to form mononitrates:</p><p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">[0090] <chemistry id=\"CHEM-US-00001\" num=\"00001\">[file=\"US09480706-20161101-C00001.TIF\"]</chemistry></p><p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">[0091] In addition, Phospholipon-90G is derived from soybean and contains esters of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, and thus, the unsaturated fatty acid part of Phospholipon-90G would react with nitric oxide to lead to a variety of nitrated products.</p><p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">[0092] Each carrier was taken in a 500 mL three necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, gas inlet and a gas outlet. The system was purged with argon for one hour at room temperature (25&#176; C.). Then nitric oxide gas was bubbled into the system. Then, nitric oxide gas was bubbled through carrier for stipulated amount of time. The changes in weight and color were noted. The details of individual experiments were as follows.</p><p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">[0093] Experiment 1. The carrier was HNC 157-62. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 24 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 168.53 g., and the final weight was 169.48 g. The net weight gained was 0.95 g and the percentage weight gain was 0.56%.</p><p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">[0094] Experiment 2. The carrier used was HNC 157-62. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 48 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 171.31 g., and the final weight was 174.21 g. The net weight gained was 2.90G and the percentage weight gain was 1.69%.</p><p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">[0095] Experiment 3. In order to differentiate between chemical reaction vs. physical absorption, the above reaction mixtures were heated at 55-60&#176; C. for four hours. Minimal loss of weight was observed (\\xcb\\x9c200 mg), indicating no loss of absorbed nitric oxide gas. However, more intense orange color developed during this process, indicating some decomposition of the nitrites formed.</p><p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">[0096] Experiment 4. The carrier used was HNC 157-65. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 24 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 171.66 g., and the final weight was 172.98 g. The net weight gained was 1.32 g and percentage weight gain was 0.77%.</p><p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">[0097] Experiment 5. The carrier used was HNC 157-69 (same as HNC 157-62, except it had no 1,3-propanediol). Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 40 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 171.02 g., and the final weight was 171.97 g. The net weight gained was 0.95 g and the percentage weight gain was 0.56%.</p><p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">[0098] Experiment 6. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled through 1,3-propanediol (neat) for 40 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of the 1,3-propanediol was 178.81 g., and the final weight was 178.97 g. The net weight gained was 0.16 g and the percentage weight gain was 0.09%.</p><p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\">[0099] Experiment 7. For preparation of 800 ppm NO, the carrier used was HNC 157-62. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 2 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 238.16 g., and the final weight was 238.35 g. The net weight gained was 0.19 g and the percentage weight gain 0.0798% (\\xcb\\x9c800 ppm). See entry 5 in Table 1.</p><p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">[0100] Experiment 8. For preparation of 500 ppm NO, the carrier used was HNC 157-65. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 2 hours at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 250.37 g., and the final weight was 250.50 g. The net weight gained was 0.13 g and the percentage weight gain was 0.0519% (\\xcb\\x9c500 ppm). See entry 6 in Table 1.</p><p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">[0101] Experiment 9. For preparation of 800 ppm NO, the carrier used was HNC 157-62. Nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 15 min at 25&#176; C. The initial weight of carrier was 252.24 g., and the final weight was 252.45 g. The net weight gained was 0.21 g and the percentage weight gain 0.083% (\\xcb\\x9c800 ppm).</p><p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">[0102] These experiments were conducted with carriers the HNC 157-62, HNC 157-65, HNC 157-69, and 1,3-propanediol.</p><p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">[0103] As described above and in Table 1, weight gains ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% were observed when nitric oxide gas was passed through the carriers. In order to determine the nature of interaction between nitric oxide and carrier, the carrier was heated after nitric oxide absorption at 60&#176; C. for four hours. Practically no loss of weight was observed, which indicated that the nitric oxide gas reacted chemically with the carriers (entries 1-4 in Table 1).</p><p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">[0104] In order to investigate the reactivity of 1,3-propanediol with nitric oxide, nitric oxide absorption was studied using (a) HNC 157-69, which did not contain 1,3-propanediol, and (b) 1,3-propanediol by itself. HNC 157-69 gained 0.95 g or 0.56% weight, much lower compared to its 1,3-propanediol containing analog HNC 157-62, which showed 1.69% weight gain (entries 2 and 5 of Table 1). 1,3-propanediol itself, surprisingly, showed only negligible, if any, weight gain when NO was passed through it (entry 6 in Table 1). Thus, under experimental conditions, 1,3-propanediol did not react with nitric oxide.</p><p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">[0105] Two samples were also prepared containing 800 ppm NO (from carrier HNC 157-62) and one sample containing 500 ppm NO (from carrier HNC 157-65) (entries 7-9 in Table 1). The IR spectra of the carriers did not show any additional bands after the reaction, possibly because of low amounts of nitrites and/or overlap with the carrier complex bands.</p><p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">[0106] Mass spectral studies of the carrier HNC 157-62 and HNC 157-62 containing NO indicated that there was an increase in the intensity of the peak at m/e 104 in NO-containing carrier, compared to carrier without NO. The peak at m/e 104 was believed to be due to choline cation (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>NO). Phospholipon-90G may contain some free choline, and hence presence of the peak at 104 in the mass spectrum of the carrier was not surprising. However, the increase in the amount of choline after passage of NO was somewhat unexpected, although it is believed that nitric oxide catalyzes similar dephosphorylation of Phospholipon-90G releasing choline.</p><p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">[0107] In conclusion, an increase in weight (0.56 to 1.69%) was observed when nitric oxide gas was passed through the carriers. 1,3-propanediol failed to gain any significant weight when nitric oxide was passed through it. HNC 157-69 (devoid of 1,3-propanediol) gained only 0.56% weight compared to 1.69% by its 1,3-propanediol containing analog HNC 157-62.

Mice with normal tails (no clipping or short) were used in this study. Ages varied between 8 weeks and 24 weeks. This procedure uses the CODA non-invasive blood pressure system available from Kent Scientific (Torrington, Conn.) Mice weighing approximately 25 grams were restrained in plastic cylindrical housing with a nose come allowing the nose to protrude. Two tail cuffs provided occlusion and measurements.

Measurements were made using a Moor\\xc2\\xae Laser Doppler instrument. Measurements were made at Day 1 before and immediately, 5 and 15 minutes after treatment.</p><p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\">[0116] The study participants were healthy females aged 30 to 55 years. They were in good health as determined by the medical history and were not taking any prescription medications. The test product was labeled as 800 ppm NO (nitric oxide). The study participants had 100 mg of the test product applied in a 2\\xc3\\x972 sq. inch area on the forearm.</p><p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\">[0117] Laser Doppler was performed to measure increased stimulation of the micro-capillary blood flow to skin. The micro-circulation of the skin reflects the perfusion of the skin and the underlying tissue. The laser Doppler technique is the standard method to obtain dynamic measurement of capillary blood flow in clinical evaluation. Measurements can be made relatively rapidly and simultaneously at sites. In addition, temperature measurements may also be made at the same time.</p><p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\">[0118] A Moor Instruments DRT4 Laser Doppler Blood Flow Monitor (Devon, England) was used. The laser Doppler technique measures blood flow in the microcapillaries of the skin that are close to the skin surface and the blood flow in underlying arterioles and venules that help to regulate skin temperature. There are several parameter used to describe blood flow measured by this laser Doppler technique. These measurement parameters are defined by Moor Instruments Inc. and are listed below.</p><p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\">[0119] Flux: This parameter is related to the product of average speed and concentration of moving red blood cells in the tissue sample volume. It is the parameter most widely reported in Laser Doppler publication.</p><p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\">[0120] Conc: This parameter gives an indication of the number of moving red blood cells in the tissue sample volume.</p><p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\">[0121] Speed: This parameter gives an indication of the average speed of red blood cells moving in the tissue sample volume.</p><p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\">[0122] Temp: This is the probe temperature and where there is good thermal conduction between probe and tissue it reaches tissue temperature.</p><p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0123\">[0123] Because of the nature of blood flow in the capillaries and other small blood vessels, absolute flow units such as ml/minute cannot be expressed. Therefore, arbitrary units are used. Blood flow changes are defined as the percentage change from the baseline of these arbitrary units.</p><p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0124\">[0124] The procedure was as follows. The laser Doppler probe was attached onto the volar forearm. Control untreated skin readings (Baseline) were obtained for 15 minutes. The test product was then applied in the designated 2\\xc3\\x972 sq. inch area and rubbed into the skin. Readings were obtained for 15 minutes.</p><p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0125\">[0125] The areas not used for evaluation include the first 15 seconds after starting data collection. Four 10 second areas in the baseline and test readings at each time point were randomly selected to obtain the mean averages which were then used in further analysis of the data.</p><p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\">[0126] The averaged data was compiled from the 4 study participants and the laser Doppler results are provided in Figure Ref. FIG. 1. There was a significant difference observed in the control untreated skin and the skin treated with 800 ppm nitric oxide up to 15 minutes after application. The applied nitric oxide had an effect on the micro circulation of the skin at the applied level (100 mg in a 2\\xc3\\x972 sq. inch area). The topical test product is capable of passing through the skin and affecting the microcirculation of the skin.</p><h4>Example 5</h4><p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\">[0127] This example illustrates delivery of nitric oxide formulations similar to those discussed herein in humans. In these studies, laser Doppler studies were performed on three human female subjects. As discussed below, all of the studies showed positive results consistent with a physiological effect of nitric oxide applied to the skin, passing through the skin and affecting the capillary circulation. The formulations used produce positive, almost immediate results when applied to the skin which, in these studies, was manifested by vasodilatation of the cutaneous vascular system.</p><p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\">[0128] While nitric oxide has many physiological effects, the purpose of these studies was to measure physiological effects that would be relatively easy to determine, and which would be noninvasive. Laser Doppler was selected for these studies because laser Doppler has a relatively large database that indicates that it is effective in determining an increase in microcirculation, i.e., circulation within the capillary bed immediately under the epidermal layer in the skin. Nitric oxide is capable of violating the capillary bed, and thus, laser Doppler was selected.</p><p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\">[0129] The formulation used in these studies contained nitric oxide dispersed in a lipid matrix. The nitric oxide was dispersed in the matrix and does not appear to be dissolved but remained intact, i.e., it appeared to diffuse into the skin as a molecule of nitric oxide rather than as atomic components or ions. Nitric oxide is a very rapid acting molecule, and these studies used a system that employed laser Doppler with a covered chamber. The formulation was placed into the chamber and then attached to the skin by an adhesive layer on the covering. This provided a stable measuring device as determined by multiple normal evaluations of the capillary blood flow without treatment of nitric oxide.</p><p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\">[0130] A known positive control, methyl nicotinate, was applied to the skin at a concentration of 1/10% in alcohol. There was a rapid response typical of the vasodilator. The vascular dynamics are such that when the blood vessels dilate physical parameters follow Bernoulli\\'\\'s law. This states that as one increases the diameter of a tube containing a liquid to flow will increase but the pressure and the speed of the liquid will decrease. The laser Doppler device accurately measured these parameters.</p><p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\">[0131] When nitric oxide was applied to the forearm of three human female subjects, it was observed that there was an immediate effect on the blood flow as soon as the formulation was applied. The speed of blood flow decreased, and the effects lasted over 15 minutes. There was no erythema and no discomfort to the subjects that was observed.</p><p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\">[0132] Thus, these studies showed that the nitric oxide in the lipid matrix when applied topically to the forearm, was able to penetrate the skin very rapidly and to interact with the underlying tissues. This is evidenced by the observation of vascular dilatation without erythema. Accordingly, it can be concluded from these studies that the formulation containing nitric oxide was effective in delivering nitric oxide through the skin in a physiologically active state.</p><p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\">[0133] In these studies, the participants were healthy females aged 30 to 55 years. They were in good health as determined by the medical history and were not taking any prescription medications. All study participants read and signed the informed consent statement prior to any study procedures being performed.</p><p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\">[0134] The test product was labeled as 10,000 ppm NO (nitric oxide). The study participants had 100 mg of the test product applied in a closed Hilltop chamber on the forearm.</p><p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\">[0135] Laser Doppler was performed to measure increased stimulation of the micro-capillary blood flow to skin. The micro-circulation of the skin reflected the perfusion of the skin and the underlying tissue.

The laser Doppler technique measured blood flow in the microcapillaries of the skin that are close to the skin surface and the blood flow in underlying arterioles and venules that help to regulate skin temperature. Because of the nature of blood flow in the capillaries and other small blood vessels, it is difficult to determine absolute flow units such as ml/minute. Therefore, arbitrary units were used in these experiments to determine relative changes. Blood flow changes were accordingly defined as the percentage change from the baseline using the arbitrary units.</p><p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\">[0137] Data was compiled from the three study participants and the laser Doppler studies and averaged. It observed that there was a significant difference observed in the control untreated skin and the skin treated with 10,000 ppm nitric oxide up to 15 minutes after application. The applied nitric oxide had an effect on the microcirculation of the skin at the applied level (100 mg in a lipid matrix). The formulation was determined to be capable of passing through the skin and affecting the microcirculation of the skin.</p><h4>Example 6</h4><p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0138\">[0138] This example illustrates a protocol used for determining the amount of nitric oxide released from various compositions of the present invention. The protocol is generally performed as follows:</p><p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0139\">[0139] 1) Samples (within HNC carriers described herein) were maintained at either 4&#176; C. or &#8722;20&#176; C. until analyzed.</p><p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0140\">[0140] 2) One at a time and before they were opened, samples were warmed to 37&#176; C. (dry bath) in a controlled atmosphere of 1% O<sub>2</sub>. They were opened and 150 microliters was removed and placed into 1.35 mL of PBS (pH 7.4, 25&#176; C. and equilibrated to 13 micromolar O<sub>2</sub>) in a small glass screw-cap vial minimizing headspace.</p><p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0141\">[0141] 3) The vials were then subjected to 15 s of vortex agitation, caps opened and 1 mL quickly removed and immediately injected into a Sievers Nitric Oxide Analyzer reaction chamber containing 4 mL of deionized and distilled H<sub>2</sub>O equilibrated at 0% O<sub>2 </sub>by a N<sub>2 </sub>flow through gas and maintained at 37&#176; C. by flow-through water jacket.</p><p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0142\">[0142] 4) Peaks were analyzed by comparing values to a standard curve generated by injecting various concentrations of the NO donor 1-(hydroxy-NNO-azoxy)-L-proline (PROLI-NONOate). To standardize among samples, the area under the curve from 0 to 4 min was used for concentration determinations are expressed in moles of NO and have been corrected for the 2 dilutions (50\\xc3\\x97). As such, these values equal moles of NO/150 microliter matrix.</p><p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0143\">[0143] 5) The authenticity of NO formation was validated by injecting 50 mM of the NO spin trap 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-oxide (cPTIO) or by injecting sample into the reaction chamber containing 50 mM cPTIO and observing the absence of signal.</p><p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0144\">[0144] 6) For each sample, the area under the curve from t=0 to t=4 min was calculated for concentration determinations. Calculations represent only the amount of NO released during this 4 min time span and thus do not represent the total amount of NO contained in the volume of matrix assessed (150 microliters). For each vial 3-5 independent determinations were performed (this means each injection represents removal of 150 microliters of matrix from the labeled vial, dilution in PBS and injection. As such, these were completely independent measurements from beginning to end.</p><p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0145\">[0145] <table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"77pt\" align=\"center\" /><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"70pt\" align=\"center\" /><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"70pt\" align=\"center\" /><tr><td namest=\"1\" nameend=\"3\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 3</td></tr><tr><td namest=\"1\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td>Sample ID</td><td>Mean (millimoles NO)</td><td>Std Dev</td></tr><tr><td namest=\"1\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td /></tr><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"77pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"70pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"70pt\" align=\"char\" char=\".\" /><tr><td>1000</td><td>11.4</td><td>1.55</td></tr><tr><td>4000</td><td>60.7</td><td>1.70</td></tr><tr><td>7000</td><td>72.1</td><td>11.9</td></tr><tr><td>10000</td><td>127.9</td><td>11.3</td></tr><tr><td namest=\"1\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\" /></tr></table><br /> In this table, the Sample ID numbers correspond to the amount of nitric oxide, in ppm, that was formulated in the composition (sample) tested. </p><p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0146\">[0146] Based on these results, the compositions tested here appeared to be effective in entrapping nitric oxide gas, and are effective in releasing the trapped gas in a measurable and significant way.</p><h4>Example 7</h4><p id=\"p-0148\" num=\"0147\">[0147] This example illustrates delivery of nitric oxide formulations to five human subjects, using procedures and formulations similar to those discussed in Example 5. Each person served as their own control for the testing. A Moor Instruments Laser Doppler was used to determine circulation. All of these studies showed positive results consistent with a physiological effect of nitric oxide applied to the skin, passing through the skin and affecting the capillary circulation. The formulations used produce positive, almost immediate results when applied to the skin which, in these studies, was manifested by vasodilatation of the cutaneous vascular system.</p><p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0148\">[0148] For each subject, the following creams were applied: a negative control formulation (containing no NO), 0.010 gram of a 10,000 ppm NO formulation, 0.020 gram of a 10,000 ppm NO formulation, and a positive control formulation containing 0.1% methyl nicotinate. The formulations were prepared using procedures similar to those discussed in Example 1.</p><p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0149\">[0149] When nitric oxide was applied to the forearm of the subjects, it was observed that there was an immediate effect on the blood flow as soon as the formulation was applied.

There was no erythema and no discomfort to the subjects that was observed.</p><p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0150\">[0150] Data was compiled from the study participants and the laser Doppler studies and averaged. It observed that there was a significant difference observed in the control untreated skin (where no detectable vasodilation was observed), and the treatments involving 0.010 g of NO, 0.020 g of NO, and methyl nicotinate. For all three treatments, vasodilatation was observed, with somewhat greater vasodilatation for the 0.010 g formulation over the 0.02 g formulation. In addition, the amount of vasodilatation observed for the 0.01 g formulation of NO was generally similar to the amount of vasodilatation observed for methyl nicotinate.</p><p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0151\">[0151] Accordingly, these data demonstrate that NO as applied in a cream to the skin is able to penetrate the skin and affect bloodflow beneath the skin.</p><p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0152\">[0152] While several embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and/or structures for performing the functions and/or obtaining the results and/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.

reference in its [UNK] idp0003 num00020002 the present invention generally relates to compositions and methods for transdermal drug delivery including treatment of acne and other [UNK] idp0004 num00030003 acne is a common skin disease typically affecting 60 percent of the population at any time most of the acne is seen in [UNK] however there can be a second [UNK] of acne in people in their late [UNK] and early [UNK] mostly in [UNK] idp0005 num00040004 acne is a systemic inflammatory disease and may be [UNK] in [UNK] due to the release of hormones as well as a proinflammatory diet [UNK] [UNK] the primary event in acne as the formation of the [UNK] ie the [UNK] of a follicle with what is believed to be [UNK] lesions caused by retention [UNK] however the [UNK] of the follicle is not the primary event but the result of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as [UNK] in the follicular wall resulting in increased [UNK] of the cells and a [UNK] pore there also may be activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor [UNK] secondary to oxidative stress in the follicle in addition fatty acids within the follicle may be proinflammatory and may [UNK] active [UNK] similar to the proinflammatory [UNK] [UNK] idp0006 num00050005 another [UNK] event is the [UNK] of the follicular wall caused by the [UNK] of [UNK] keratinocytes this [UNK] can release phospholipids

or more systems andor articlespp idp0009 num00080008 in one aspect provided herein is a method comprising administering to the skin of a subject having or at risk of acne a composition comprising an effective amount of nitric oxide and a carrier having a phosphatidylcholine component entrapping the nitric oxidepp idp0010 num00090009 in another aspect provided herein is a method comprising contacting the skin of a subject at a location where treatment of acne is desired with a composition comprising an emulsion comprising a first phase comprising nitric oxide and lecithin and a second phase comprising an emulsifier wherein the lecithin is present at least about 025 by weight of the composition and wherein the first phase comprises no more than about 250 ppm of water by weight of the compositionpp idp0011 num00100010 several methods are disclosed herein of administering a subject with a compound for prevention or treatment of a particular condition it is to be understood that in each such aspect of the invention the invention specifically includes also the compound for use in the treatment or prevention of that particular condition as well as use of the compound for the

invention generally relates to compositions and methods for treatment of subjects having or at risk of acne or other conditions in some cases the composition may include nitric oxide the nitric oxide may be present within a first phase comprising a lecithin such as phosphatidylcholine in certain embodiments the lecithin is present in liposomes micelles or other vesicles containing nitric oxide the composition can take the form of a gel a cream a lotion an ointment a solution a solid “stick” etc that can be rubbed or sprayed onto the skin eg onto a location with acne or on another suitable portion of the skin other aspects of the present invention are generally directed to methods of making or using such compositions methods of promoting such compositions kits including such compositions or the likepp idp0016 num00150015 according to one aspect of the present invention a composition as described herein is used to treat acne or other conditions to “treat” a disorder means to reduce or eliminate a sign or symptom of the disorder to stabilize the disorder andor to reduce or slow further progression of the disorder thus in one set of embodiments the application of nitric oxide eg in a nitric [UNK] matrix to acne lesions and the surrounding skin may result in clinical improvement in some cases the delivery of nitric oxide to the skin eg to the epidermis andor dermis may be achieved at a controlled rate andor concentration without wishing to be bound by any theory it is believed that nitric oxide may block cytokine production and therefore the primary event of [UNK] retention [UNK] may be [UNK] in addition in some cases the natural antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of nitric oxide may prevent the [UNK] cascade that results in clinically apparent inflammatory lesions also antimicrobial effects of nitric oxide may be used to clear [UNK] of secondary infection eg from [UNK] idp0017 num00160016 in some embodiments the nitric oxide in the composition is stable at room temperature and may remain active for extended periods of time eg at least 1 year at least 15 years at least 2 years at least 25 years at least 3 years at least 4 years etc the nitric oxide may be released for example when the composition is exposed to an aqueous environment eg within the body without wishing to be bound by any theory it is believed that when the composition is applied to the skin the liquid crystal structure [UNK] delivering nitric oxide to eg an acne lesion or other desired area of treatment the concentration of the nitric oxide inside the liquid crystal matrix can be varied in terms of concentration the matrix also may act as a sustained release and delivery system in some embodiments it is also believed that the liquid crystal is highly penetrating such that nitric oxide can be delivered to the epidermis dermis and dermal vascular for systemic release as well as to subcutaneous fat at least under some conditionspp idp0018 num00170017 thus in one set of embodiments application of nitric oxide eg in a penetrating matrix gel delivering the active nitric oxide may act as a [UNK] of andor be used to treat acne in another set of embodiments a composition as described herein is applied to the skin of a subject eg one having or at risk of acne for instance in some embodiments a composition as is described herein is contacted with the skin of a subject at a location where treatment of acne is desiredpp idp0019 num00180018 in some cases the subject may be one that already has acne eg located on the face the chest the back etc however in other cases the subject may not necessarily have acne but may be one that is at risk of developing acne for instance the subject may be one that is an [UNK] or soon to be an [UNK] in some cases the subject may be 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 or 21 years old the subject may also be one that exhibits relatively oily skin or increased production of sebum from the sebaceous glands eg relative to the general population or relative to the same subject at an [UNK] age the subject may also be one with a family history of [UNK] idp0020 num00190019 in some cases the application of nitric oxide eg as discussed herein may occur in conjunction with other systems and methods of acne treatment eg using medications such as benzoyl peroxide antibiotics retinoids [UNK] medications [UNK] medications hormonal treatments salicylic acid alpha hydroxy acid azelaic acid [UNK] [UNK] soaps [UNK] oil tea tree oil andor aloe vera andor other treatments such as [UNK] [UNK] laser treatments [UNK] penetrating light therapy [UNK] therapy or the likepp idp0021 num00200020 in accordance with some embodiments of the invention nitric oxide gas itself may be entrapped or contained within various compositions as discussed herein for example in liquid crystal multilamellar phosphatidylcholine in addition in certain embodiments as discussed below the composition may be stable and can be stored for periods of time with little or no loss or reaction of the nitric oxide contained thereinpp idp0022 num00210021 since nitric oxide is an unstable and reactive gas [UNK] storage and release of nitric oxide requires careful formulation in some embodiments of the invention for example nitric oxide readily reacts with water to form nitrous acid [UNK] and thus certain embodiments of the invention include compositions or phases that are substantially free of water as another example in one set of embodiments nitric oxide may be contained within a first phase comprising a lecithin such as phosphatidylcholine which may be present within a second phase comprising an emulsifier such as is discussed herein other components for example transdermal penetration enhancers adjuvants surfactants lubricants etc can also be present in certain casespp idp0023 num00220022 thus the compositions of the invention comprise in certain aspects a phase comprising phosphatidylcholine andor other lecithins in which nitric oxide is contained within or [UNK] the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin may be contained within a second phase for example comprising an emulsifier which may cause the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin to form vesicles eg micelles or liposomes the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin composition can be unilamellar or multilamellar in some embodiments in some instances the presence of the second phase causes the phosphatidylcholine or lecithin to form a liquid crystal [UNK] idp0024 num00230023 the nitric oxide is typically gaseous and may be present within the composition as small bubbles andor bound to lecithins or phosphatidylcholines within the composition for example the nitric oxide may be bound to double bonds present in the lecithins or phosphatidylcholines phosphatidylcholine is believed to stabilize andor contain the nitric oxide in some cases stability of the composition can be achieved at room temperature about 25176 c andor at other temperatures such as those described herein without wishing to be bound by any theory it is believed that the phosphatidylcholine [UNK] a liquid crystal structure under such conditions which can thereby contain the nitric oxide eg as small gaseous bubbles andor through binding with lecithins or [UNK] idp0025 num00240024 nitric oxide is typically reactive with water eg forming nitrous acid which contributes to its relatively short lifetime within the body or within other aqueous environments accordingly in certain embodiments of the invention the composition or at least a phase of the composition comprising the nitric oxide andor the second phase andor one or more materials used to prepare a nitric oxide composition andor a nitric oxide composition prepared as described herein is substantially free of water eg comprising no more than about 10 wt no more than about 3 wt no more than about 1 wt no more than about 03 wt or no more than about 01 wt water ie relative to the weight of the overall composition the composition may also have no more than about 1000 ppm no more than about 750 ppm no more than about 500 ppm no more than about 400 ppm no more

useful for instance for product [UNK] in the [UNK] eg when applied to the skin of a subject however in other embodiments the composition is not necessarily transparent certain substances can be useful in providing a substantially transparent composition for example fatty acid esters such as ascorbate palmitate or isopropyl palmitate in one set of embodiments the composition may be substantially transparent such that incident visible light eg have wavelengths of between about 400 nm and about 700 nm can be transmitted through 1 cm of the composition with a loss in intensity of no more than about 50 about 60 about 70 about 80 or about 90 relative to the incident light in some embodiments there may be no substantial difference in the wavelengths that are absorbed by the composition ie

volatile organic fluids fatty acids volatile aromatic cyclic compounds high molecular weight hydrocarbons or the likepp idp0048 num00470047 in accordance with certain aspects of the invention the composition may be prepared by mixing a first phase and a second phase together then passing nitric oxide through the mixture as discussed above the second phase can comprise an emulsifier or any other components discussed herein the first phase may comprise a lecithin such as phosphatidylcholine andor polyenylphosphatidylcholine eg ppcenriched phosphatidylcholine for instance as described herein in some embodiments other components are also mixed into the composition before or after or while adding nitric oxide for example transdermal penetration enhancers adjuvants [UNK] eg peg andor ppg surfactants lubricants etc as discussed herein in some embodiments however nitric oxide may be passed through the first phase prior to mixing of the first phase with the second phasepp idp0049 num00480048 in one set of embodiments after forming the mixture nitric oxide can be passed into or through the mixture for example by [UNK] bubbles of nitric oxide through the mixture nitric oxide may be delivered into the mixture under pressures such as between about 3000 pa and about 15000 pa between about 5000 pa and about 10000 pa or between about 6000 pa and about 8000 pa andor temperatures such as between about 0176 c and about 50176 c between about 20176 c and about 35176 c or about 25176 c and about 30176 c however higher or lower pressures also may be used in some embodiments as aspects of the invention are not limited in this [UNK] idp0050 num00490049 in certain embodiments the nitric oxide is bubbled through the mixture until the mixture begins to at least partially

or at least about [UNK] cp the nitric oxide can be passed through the mixture as pure nitric oxide andor with other gases eg a noble gas for example argon in some cases a nitric oxide donor may be passed into the mixture and therein at least some of the nitric oxide donor can be converted into nitric oxide in other embodiments however the final composition may have lower viscosities for example such that the composition is liquid or could be sprayed onto the skinpp idp0051 num00500050 in one set of embodiments the nitric oxide can be bubbled through the mixture to cause the viscosity of the mixture to increase for example the viscosity can increase until the mixture begins to form a gel a cream a lotion an ointment a solid “stick” or the like a cream may be for example a semisolid emulsion eg comprising a first phase and a second phase the first phase may be discontinuous eg comprising small droplets or vesicles such as is discussed herein and the second phase may be continuous or vice versa in some cases however both the first phase and the second phase are [UNK] within the mixturepp idp0052 num00510051 in some embodiments of the invention a composition may be prepared as discussed above then diluted eg with a diluent to produce a final composition for example a [UNK] composition may be initially prepared eg having a relatively high nitric oxide concentration then the stock composition diluted to produce a final composition eg before use before storage before packaging etc in some embodiments the diluent used may be a component as discussed herein for example forming at least a portion of the second phase and the same or different materials than may be present in the initial composition may be used the dilution ratio amount of diluent added relative to the

about 100 or any other suitable [UNK] idp0053 num00520052 a composition may be prepared andor stored at any suitable temperature and under any suitable conditions in some embodiments for instance a composition can be prepared andor stored under limited or no oxygen conditions as oxygen can adversely react with nitric oxide the composition can also be prepared andor stored under limited or no nitrogen andor carbon dioxide as both can also react adversely with nitric oxide for instance the composition may be prepared andor stored in a sealed environment eg stored in a sealed container the sealed environment eg container can be at least substantially devoid of gas andor contains a gaseous mixture that [UNK] or at least is depleted in oxygen in some embodiments an environment depleted in oxygen may have less than about 20 less than about 15 less than about 10 less than about 5 about 1 or less about 01 or less about 001 or less about 0001 or less oxygen eg as a wt or as molar per volume for example the gaseous mixture may include a noble gas such as argon [UNK] [UNK] etc in one set of embodiments the container may comprise a [UNK] metallic andor polymeric barrier eg formed from [UNK] american can company for instance the container may have the shape of a tube thus in certain embodiments the container is substantially resistant to oxygen permeation nitrogen permeation andor carbon dioxide permeation in certain embodiments the container is substantially [UNK] for example such that substantially no water is absorbed by the container or such that no water is able to pass through the container even if the container is filled with waterpp idp0054 num00530053 as previously discussed nitric oxide can react with water and thus compositions described herein may be prepared andor stored under conditions where substantially no water is present for example nitric oxide andor a nitric oxide containing preparation described herein may be prepared andor stored under relatively low relative [UNK] eg less than about 50 rh less than about 40 rh less than about 30 rh less than about 20 rh or less than about 10 rh andor in the presence of a suitable [UNK] such as phosphorous [UNK] or silica [UNK] idp0055 num00540054 in certain embodiments the mixture may be mixed with or otherwise include adjunct ingredients if applicable and nitric oxide may be introduced to the mixture eg bubbles of nitric oxide gas may be blown into the mixture until the mixture [UNK] to obtain the desired final composition as a specific nonlimiting example a nitric oxide composition may be formed by preparing a [UNK] multilamellar liquid crystal phosphatidylcholine phase for example by providing a polyglycol then introducing phosphatidyl choline into the glycol at room temperature to form a phosphatidylcholine solution the phosphatidylcholine often comes as a solid eg as a [UNK] of material and the phosphatidylcholine may be broken down into smaller pieces to aid in mixing eg by [UNK] or grinding the phosphatidylcholine solid the phosphatidylcholine solution is mixed until the phosphatidylcholine solution is substantially clear then one may warm the phosphatidylcholine solution to 40176 c mill the warmed solution ie low agitation after the initial mixing combine siloxylated polyether and polydimethylsiloxane to form a fluid add the fluid to the warmed solution and milling until the solution is clear adding methyl paraben or other suitable lubricant to the solution and milling until the methyl paraben dissolves in the solution warm water to 40176 c and adding the warmed water slowly to the solution and then [UNK] milling of the solution and [UNK] the solution eg with a sweep mixer to cool to room temperature nitric oxide gas can then be bubbled or otherwise introduced into the solution while cooling the solution until the solution begins to [UNK] or becomes stiff eg having the consistency of a gel or a cream such as previously described in some cases the resulting composition is sealed in a container for example as discussed herein any suitable container may be used eg a tube or a bottle in addition the composition eg within the container may be stored at room temperature or any other suitable temperature for example a composition of the invention may be stored at or below 80176 c eg at or below room temperature about 25176 c or in a [UNK] eg at 4176 c for extended period of storage for instance to prevent nitric oxide leakage or [UNK] in some cases storage may extend for at least about a week at least about 4 weeks at least about 6 months at least about a year etcpp idp0056 num00550055 it is surprising that according to some embodiments nitric oxide not only can be entrapped in phosphatidylcholine or lecithin compositions such as those described herein but also that such entrapped compositions may have a long shelf life especially when refrigerated no loss or reaction of nitric oxide is expected during extended refrigerated storage at least under certain conditions for instance in certain embodiments the composition may be stored at temperatures of less than about 80176 c less than about 70176 c less than about 60176 c less than about 50176 c less than about 40176 c less than about 30176 c less than about 25176 c less than about 20176 c less than about 15176 c less than about 10176 c less than about 5176 c less than about 0176 c etc for extended periods of time eg at least about a day at least about a week at least about 4 weeks at least about 6 months etcpp idp0057 num00560056 without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that nitric oxide forms [UNK] physical bonds similar to hydrogen bonds or van der waals forces with phosphatidylcholine or other lecithin molecules eg containing one or more double bonds which may allow nitric oxide to become entrapped and thereby remain intact for an extended period of time eg during storage these physical bonds however are believed to be not very stable and may in some cases be easily broken up for example upon various physical [UNK] such as rubbing the composition against the skin thereby releasing the entrapped nitric oxide while others have stabilized other substances or drugs within phosphatidylcholine or lecithin compositions or vesicles for example protein drugs such as insulin it is surprising that a small highly reactive molecule such as no could similarly be stabilized especially when it would have been expected that a molecule as small as no would readily diffuse away from such compositions andor would have reacted with water that is typically present within such compositionspp idp0058 num00570057 in some embodiments it is believed that other species reactive with water could also be similarly stabilized eg within a composition as herein described any species that ordinarily reacts with water could be stabilized within such compositions examples of such species include but are not limited to lithium or drugs or polymers with [UNK] bonds susceptible to hydrolysis for instance certain peptides polysaccharides polylactic acid [UNK] acid etcpp idp0059 num00580058 in certain aspects of the invention a composition such as those described herein can be administered to a subject such as a human subject by rubbing it on the skin of the subject eg in areas located at or at least within the vicinity of a desired target area without wishing to be bound by any theory it is believed that phosphatidylcholine provides or facilitates delivery of nitric oxide to the skin allowing nitric oxide to be delivered to a target area in some embodiments the composition can be applied by rubbing the composition topically against the skin which allows the composition or at least nitric oxide to be absorbed by the skin the composition can be applied once or more than once for example the composition may be administered at predetermined intervals in some embodiments for instance the composition may be applied once per day twice per day 3 times per day 4 times per day once every other day once every three days once every four days etc the amount of nitric oxide necessary to bring about the therapeutic treatment is not fixed per se and may depend upon factors such as the desired outcome the type and severity the disease or condition the form of nitric oxide the concentration of nitric oxide present within the composition etcpp idp0060 num00590059 thus another aspect of the invention provides methods of administering any composition such as discussed herein to a subject the compositions of the invention may be applied to a subject for local or systemic delivery depending on the application the compositions of the invention may also be applied to any suitable area of the skin for example the compositions may be applied to the upper chest or arms or to any hairy or [UNK] portion of the skin eg to promote systemic delivery of nitric oxide or the composition may be applied locally eg at an area of the skin where treatment is desiredpp idp0061 num00600060 when administered the compositions of the invention are applied in a therapeutically effective pharmaceutically acceptable amount as a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation any of the compositions of the present invention may be administered to the subject in a therapeutically effective dose

sufficient to have a measurable positive effect on blood flow andor vasodilation andor a measurable negative effect on blood pressure in some embodiments the effect on blood flow andor vasodilation is observed local to the site of topical application in some embodiments an effective amount is an amount sufficient to have a measurable effect on acne as evidenced by an appropriate clinical parameter eg percent change in inflammatory acne lesion counts percent change in non inflammatory acne lesion count percent change in total acne lesion counts in some embodiments an effective amount is an amount sufficient to obtain a systemic level of nitric oxide that is sufficient to have a desired effect eg have a measurable positive effect on blood flow andor vasodilation have a measurable negative effect on blood pressure andor have a measurable effect on acne as evidenced by an appropriate clinical [UNK] idp0063 num00620062 the compositions described herein can be used in combination

administered separately or in conjunction in addition the administration of one element may be prior to concurrent to or subsequent to the administration of the other agent in certain embodiments the additional therapeutic agent is present in a provided composition in addition to nitric oxide in other embodiments the additional therapeutic agent is administered separately from the nitric oxide containing compositionpp idp0064 num00630063 when coadministered with other agents eg when coadministered with another antiacne medication an “effective amount” of the second agent will depend on the

examples are intended to illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the inventionph4example 1h4p idp0087 num00860086 this example illustrates one technique for preparing a composition in accordance with one embodiment of the invention an accurate amount of a carrier hnc [UNK] see below was introduced into a system the carrier weight used in these experiments was approximately 250 g and the vessel size was 500 ml the vessel was equipped with a mechanical stirrer gas inlet and gas outlet and was previously purged with argon for about an hour the temperature of the carrier was kept at about [UNK] c no gas regulated at 5 psi 1 psi is about [UNK] pa and was then introduced at a controlled rate of about 1 bubbles with continuous stirring the color consistency and viscosity of the carrier did not appear to change if no was bubbled for 30 minutes to 2 hours after 6 hours the weight of the carrier had increased by 015 by 12 hours by 025 and by 24 hours by 056 these increases in weight were believed to be significant considering the relative small molecular weight of no versus the carrier although there was a slight change in color during the experiment the color changed to slightly more orange ir spectrum analysis of the final product did not show any change versus the initial carrier indicating no noticeable chemical change in the carrier the carrier also can solidify upon cooling if the carrier is initially a solid at lower temperature accordingly this example demonstrates that a composition containing no can be prepared in accordance with one embodiment of the inventionph4example 2h4p idp0088 num00870087 in this example six experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction of nitric oxide with three carriers hnc 15762 hnc 15765 and hnc 15769 as well as with 13propanediol using experimental conditions similar to that described for example 1 in addition three experiments were performed to prepare carriers containing 800 ppm and 500 ppm nitric oxide hnc 15762 was formed of 65 phospholipon90g american lecithin company 18 isopropyl palmitate kraft chemicals 8 capric caprylic triglycerides [UNK] corp and 9 propanediol dupont hnc 15765 was formed of 65 phospholipon90g 13 isopropyl palmitate 14 capric caprylic triglycerides 3 propanediol and 5 dimethyl isosorbide croda hnc 15769 was formed from 65 phospholipon90g 16 isopropyl palmitate and 19 capric caprylic [UNK] idp0089 num00880088 the compositions were generally prepared as follows isopropyl palmitate capric caprylic triglyceride propanediol for hnc 15762 and hnc 15765 and dimethyl isosorbide for hnc 15765 were mixed together and warmed to 40176 c phospholipon90g was then gradually added to this liquid mixture by mixing it phospholipon90g is typically received as individual [UNK] and is mixed into the solution until fully dissolved the mixture was subsequently filtered through a [UNK] to remove any undissolved [UNK] idp0090 num00890089 accordingly the hnc carriers included 13propanediol phospholipon90g isopropyl palmitate capric andor caporic triglycerides and arlasolve dmi [UNK] america or croda isopropyl palmitate the capric andor caporic triglycerides and arlasolve dmi are expected to be chemically inert towards nitric oxide while the literature suggests that 12propanediol and glycerol may be able to react with nitric oxide gas to form [UNK] accordingly it would be expected that 13propanediol may also react with no to form [UNK] idp0091 num00900090 chemistry idchemus00001 [UNK] idp0092 num00910091 in addition phospholipon90g is derived from soybean and contains esters of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic linoleic and linolenic acids and thus the unsaturated fatty acid part of phospholipon90g would react with nitric oxide to lead to a variety of [UNK] productspp idp0093 num00920092 each carrier was taken in a 500 ml three [UNK] flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer gas inlet and a gas outlet the system was purged with argon for one hour at room temperature 25176 c then nitric oxide gas was bubbled into the system then nitric oxide gas was bubbled through carrier for [UNK] amount of time the changes in weight and color were noted the details of individual experiments were as followspp idp0094 num00930093 experiment 1 the carrier was hnc 15762 nitric oxide gas was

experiment 2 the carrier used was hnc 15762 nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 48 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was [UNK] and the percentage weight gain was [UNK] idp0096 num00950095 experiment 3 in order to [UNK] between chemical reaction vs physical absorption the above reaction mixtures were heated at [UNK] c for four hours minimal loss of weight was observed [UNK] mg indicating no loss of absorbed nitric oxide gas however more intense orange color developed during this process indicating some decomposition of the nitrites formedpp idp0097 num00960096 experiment 4 the carrier used was hnc 15765 nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 24 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 132 g and percentage weight gain was [UNK] idp0098 num00970097 experiment 5 the carrier used was hnc 15769 same as hnc 15762 except it had no 13propanediol nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 40 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 095 g and the percentage weight gain was [UNK] idp0099 num00980098 experiment 6 nitric oxide gas was bubbled through 13propanediol neat for 40 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of the 13propanediol was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 016 g and the percentage weight gain was [UNK] idp0100 num00990099 experiment 7 for preparation of 800 ppm no the carrier used was hnc 15762 nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 2 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 019 g and the percentage weight gain [UNK] ˜800 ppm see entry 5 in table 1pp idp0101 num01000100 experiment 8 for preparation of 500 ppm no the carrier used was hnc 15765 nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 2 hours at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 013 g and the percentage weight gain was [UNK] [UNK] ppm see entry 6 in table 1pp idp0102 num01010101 experiment 9 for preparation of 800 ppm no the carrier used was hnc 15762 nitric oxide gas was bubbled for 15 min at 25176 c the initial weight of carrier was [UNK] g and the final weight was [UNK] g the net weight gained was 021 g and the percentage weight gain [UNK] ˜800 ppmpp idp0103 num01020102 these experiments were conducted with carriers the hnc 15762 hnc 15765 hnc 15769 and [UNK] idp0104 num01030103 as described above and in table 1 weight [UNK] ranging from 05 to 17 were observed when nitric oxide gas was passed through the carriers in order to determine the nature of interaction between nitric oxide and carrier the carrier was heated after nitric oxide absorption at 60176 c for four hours [UNK] no loss of weight was observed which indicated that the nitric oxide gas reacted chemically with the carriers entries 14 in table 1pp idp0105 num01040104 in order to investigate the reactivity of 13propanediol with nitric oxide nitric oxide absorption was studied using a hnc 15769 which did not contain 13propanediol and b 13propanediol by itself hnc 15769 gained 095 g or 056 weight much lower compared to its 13propanediol containing analog hnc 15762 which showed 169 weight gain entries 2 and 5 of table 1 13propanediol itself surprisingly showed only [UNK] if any weight gain when no was passed through it entry 6 in table 1 thus under experimental conditions 13propanediol did not react with nitric oxidepp idp0106 num01050105 two samples were also prepared containing 800 ppm no from carrier hnc 15762 and one sample containing 500 ppm no from carrier hnc 15765 entries 79 in table 1 the ir spectra of the carriers did not show any additional bands after the reaction possibly because of low amounts of nitrites andor overlap with the carrier complex [UNK] idp0107 num01060106 mass spectral studies of the carrier hnc 15762 and hnc 15762 containing no indicated that there was an increase in the intensity of the peak at me 104 in [UNK] carrier compared to carrier without no the peak at me 104 was believed to be due to choline cation [UNK] phospholipon90g may contain some free choline and hence presence of the peak at 104 in the mass spectrum of the carrier was not surprising however the increase in the amount of choline after passage of no was somewhat unexpected although it is believed that nitric oxide [UNK] similar [UNK] of phospholipon90g releasing [UNK] idp0108 num01070107 in conclusion an increase in weight 056 to 169 was observed when nitric oxide gas was passed through the carriers 13propanediol failed to gain any significant weight when nitric oxide was passed through it hnc 15769 devoid of 13propanediol gained only 056 weight compared to 169 by its 13propanediol containing analog hnc 15762 the mass spectra of hnc 15762 before and after passing no indicated that the peak corresponding to choline at me 104 increased after the passage of no which suggests that phospholipon90g may undergo [UNK] [UNK] idp0109 num01080108 table framenone colsep0 rowsep0

idp0116 num01150115 microcirculation properties of the skin were measured before and after application of a test product with nitric oxide measurements were made using a [UNK] laser doppler instrument measurements were made at day 1 before and immediately 5 and 15 minutes after treatmentpp idp0117 num01160116 the study participants were healthy females aged 30 to 55 years they were in good health as determined by the medical history and were not taking any prescription medications the test product was labeled as 800 ppm no nitric oxide the study participants had 100 mg of the test product applied in a 2×2 sq inch area on the forearmpp idp0118 num01170117 laser doppler was performed to measure increased stimulation of the microcapillary blood flow to skin the microcirculation of the skin [UNK] the perfusion of the skin and the underlying tissue the laser doppler technique is the standard method to obtain dynamic measurement of capillary blood flow in clinical evaluation measurements can be made relatively rapidly and simultaneously at sites in addition temperature measurements may also be made at the same timepp idp0119 num01180118 a moor instruments drt4 laser doppler blood flow monitor devon england was used the laser doppler technique measures blood flow in the microcapillaries of the skin that are close to the skin surface and the blood flow in underlying arterioles and venules that help to regulate skin temperature there are several parameter used to describe blood flow measured by this laser doppler technique these measurement parameters are defined by moor instruments inc and are listed belowpp idp0120 num01190119 flux this parameter is related to the product of average speed and concentration of moving red blood cells in the tissue sample volume it is the parameter most widely reported in laser doppler [UNK] idp0121 num01200120 conc this parameter gives an indication of the number of moving red blood cells in the tissue sample volumepp idp0122 num01210121 speed this parameter gives an indication of the average speed of red blood cells moving in the tissue sample volumepp idp0123 num01220122 temp this is the probe temperature and where there is good thermal [UNK] between probe and tissue it [UNK] tissue temperaturepp idp0124 num01230123 because of the nature of blood flow in the capillaries and other small blood vessels absolute flow units such as mlminute cannot be expressed therefore arbitrary units are used blood flow changes are defined as the percentage change from the baseline of these arbitrary unitspp idp0125 num01240124 the procedure was as follows the laser doppler probe was attached onto the [UNK] forearm control untreated skin readings baseline were obtained for 15 minutes the test product was then applied in the designated 2×2 sq inch area and rubbed into the skin readings were obtained for 15 minutespp idp0126 num01250125 the areas not used for evaluation include the first 15 seconds after starting data collection four 10 second areas in the baseline and test readings at each time point were randomly selected to obtain the mean averages which were then used in further analysis of the [UNK] idp0127 num01260126 the averaged data was compiled from the 4 study participants and the laser doppler results are provided in figure ref fig 1 there was a significant difference observed in the control untreated skin and the skin treated with 800 ppm nitric oxide up to 15 minutes after application the applied nitric oxide had an effect on the micro circulation of the skin at the applied level 100 mg in a 2×2 sq inch area the topical test product is capable of passing through the skin and affecting the microcirculation of the skinph4example 5h4p idp0128 num01270127 this example illustrates delivery of nitric oxide formulations similar to those discussed herein in humans in these studies laser doppler studies were performed on three human female subjects as discussed below all of the studies showed positive results consistent with a physiological effect of nitric oxide applied to the skin passing through the skin and affecting the capillary circulation the formulations used produce positive almost immediate results when applied to the skin which in these studies was manifested by vasodilatation of the cutaneous vascular systempp idp0129 num01280128 while nitric oxide has many physiological effects the purpose of these studies was to measure physiological effects that would be relatively easy to determine and which would be noninvasive laser doppler was selected for these studies because laser doppler has a relatively large [UNK] that indicates that it is effective in determining an increase in microcirculation ie circulation within the capillary bed immediately under the epidermal layer in the skin nitric oxide is capable of [UNK] the capillary bed and thus laser doppler was selectedpp idp0130 num01290129 the formulation used in these studies contained nitric oxide dispersed in a lipid matrix the nitric oxide was dispersed in the matrix and does not appear to be dissolved but remained intact ie it appeared to diffuse into the skin as a molecule of nitric oxide rather than as atomic components or ions nitric oxide is a very rapid acting molecule and these studies used a system that employed laser doppler with a covered chamber the formulation was placed into the chamber and then attached to the skin by an adhesive layer on the covering this provided a stable measuring device as determined by multiple normal evaluations of the capillary blood flow without treatment of nitric oxidepp idp0131 num01300130 a known positive control methyl nicotinate was applied to the skin at a concentration of 110 in alcohol there was a rapid response typical of the [UNK] the vascular [UNK] are such that when the blood vessels [UNK] physical parameters follow [UNK] law this states that as one increases the diameter of a tube containing a liquid to flow will increase but the pressure and the speed of the liquid will decrease the laser doppler device accurately measured these [UNK] idp0132 num01310131 when nitric oxide was applied to the forearm of three human female subjects it was observed that there was an immediate effect on the blood flow as soon as the formulation was applied the speed of blood flow decreased and the effects lasted over 15 minutes there was no erythema and no discomfort to the subjects that was observedpp idp0133 num01320132 thus these studies showed that the nitric oxide in the lipid matrix when applied topically to the forearm was able to penetrate the skin very rapidly and to interact with the underlying tissues this is evidenced by the observation of vascular [UNK] without erythema accordingly it can be concluded from these studies that the formulation containing nitric oxide was effective in delivering nitric oxide through the skin in a physiologically active statepp idp0134 num01330133 in these studies the participants were healthy females aged 30 to 55 years they were in good health as determined by the medical history and were not taking any prescription

microcapillary blood flow to skin the microcirculation of the skin reflected the perfusion of the skin and the underlying tissue laser doppler is a standard method to obtain dynamic measurement of

are close to the skin surface and the blood flow in underlying arterioles and venules that help to regulate skin temperature because of the nature of blood flow in the capillaries and other small blood vessels it is difficult to determine absolute flow units such as mlminute therefore arbitrary units were used in these experiments to determine relative changes blood flow changes were accordingly defined as the percentage change from the baseline using the arbitrary unitspp idp0138 num01370137 data was compiled from the three study participants and the laser doppler studies and averaged it observed that there was a significant difference observed in the control untreated skin and the skin treated with 10000 ppm nitric oxide up to 15 minutes after application the applied

vasodilation was observed and the treatments involving 0010 g of no 0020 g of no and methyl nicotinate for all three treatments vasodilatation was observed with somewhat greater vasodilatation for the 0010 g formulation over the 002 g formulation in addition the amount of vasodilatation observed for the 001 g formulation of no was generally similar to the amount of vasodilatation observed for methyl [UNK] idp0152 num01510151 accordingly these data demonstrate that no as applied in a cream to the skin is able to penetrate the skin and affect [UNK] [UNK] the skinpp idp0153 num01520152 while

all definitions as defined and used herein should be understood to control over dictionary definitions definitions in documents incorporated by reference andor ordinary meanings of the defined [UNK] idp0155 num01540154 the indefinite articles “a” and “an” as used herein in the specification and in the claims unless clearly indicated to the contrary should be understood to mean “at least [UNK] idp0156 num01550155 the phrase “andor” as used herein in the specification and in the claims should be understood to mean [UNK] or both” of the elements so conjoined ie elements that are [UNK] present in some cases and [UNK] present in other cases multiple elements listed with “andor” should be construed in the same fashion ie “one or more” of the elements so conjoined other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the “andor” [UNK] whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified thus as a nonlimiting example a reference to “a andor b” when used in conjunction with openended language such as “comprising” can refer in one embodiment to a only optionally including elements other than b in another embodiment to b only optionally including elements other than a in yet another embodiment to both a and b optionally including other elements etcpp idp0157 num01560156 as used herein in the specification and in the claims “or” should be understood to have the same meaning as “andor” as defined above for example when separating items in a list “or” or “andor” shall be interpreted as being inclusive ie the inclusion of at least one but also including more than one of a number or list of elements and optionally additional [UNK] items only terms clearly indicated to the contrary such as “only one of” or “exactly one of” or when used in the claims “consisting of” will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements in general the term “or” as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives ie “one or the other but not both” when [UNK] by terms of [UNK] such as [UNK] “one of” “only one of” or “exactly one of” “consisting essentially of” when used in the claims shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent [UNK] idp0158 num01570157 as used herein in the specification and in the claims the phrase “at least one” in reference to a list of one or more elements should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements this definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase “at least one” refers whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified thus as a nonlimiting example “at least one of a and b” or equivalently “at least one of a or b” or equivalently “at least one of a andor b” can refer in one embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one a with no b present and optionally including elements other than b in another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one b with no a present and optionally including elements other than a in yet another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one a and at least one optionally including more than one b and optionally including other elements etcpp
